DONALD TRUMP: The fact that Hillary thinks the temporary Muslim ban, which she calls the "Muslim ban," promotes terrorism, proves Bernie Sanders was correct when he said she is not qualified to be President.

Look at the carnage all over the world including the World Trade Center, San Bernardino, Paris, the USS Cole, Brussels and an unlimited number of other places. She and our totally ignorant President won't even use the term "Radical Islamic Terrorism." And by the way, ask Hillary who blew up the plane last night -- another terrible, but preventable tragedy. She has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President at this delicate and difficult time in our country's history.
