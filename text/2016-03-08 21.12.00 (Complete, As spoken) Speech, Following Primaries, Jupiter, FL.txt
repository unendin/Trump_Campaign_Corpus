DONALD TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you very much everyone. This has been an amazing evening. And I don't think I've ever had so many horrible, horrible things said about me in one week. (LAUGHTER) Thirty-eight million dollars' worth of horrible lies, but that's OK. It shows you how brilliant the public is because they knew they were lies and it was just really amazing to watch. And to get these kind of numbers where they call them immediately is just something very special. So I want to thank the public. I want to thank the people of Michigan. I want to thank the people of Mississippi. And it is such a great honor.

And it's also really wonderful to have you at Trump National Golf Club. Jack Nicklaus did this. It's a Jack Nicklaus signature course and it's a great, great resort and place. And we have a lot of our members here, I see.

(APPLAUSE)

We love our members. Jack -- Jack -- by the way, Jack Nicklaus is a special man and he did a special job and we love Jack.

And we have another special man, Paul O'Neill of the Yankees. Come -- stand up, Paul. Paul -- in fact, Paul, you come -- you originally come from Ohio, right? Oh wow, Paul O'Neill of the Yankees. Hey Paul, you come from Ohio? Do you endorse me? I love you. Thank you, Paul. Thank you. Wow. That's a great endorsement from Ohio.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you. He's great. It looks like he could go out there right now.

So I just wanted to tell you that it was really an interesting week, an amazing week. I want to congratulate a lot of people, including the candidates. I mean, this is not easy stuff. When you're -- when you're doing this it is -- it's pretty wild.

And I must tell you it's very, very important, as a Republican, that our senators and that our congressmen get rreelected, that we put a good group of people together, that we keep the people that are there. We have some terrific people. Not all of them are on my side but we have some terrific people and it's very, very important. If we're going to be effective, it's very, very important.

One of the things I'm most happy about is that the turnout has been just massive for every -- every week, whether it's South Carolina or any -- pretty much with New Hampshire and it really -- Iowa. No matter where you go, it's records. I think it's actually the single biggest story in politics today, what's happening at the booth and the tremendous number of people that are coming out to vote. Some of the states are getting -- in fact, one has 102 percent increase over four years ago. It's amazing -- 102 percent.

(APPLAUSE)

On average, you're talking about probably more than 50 percent. You're talking about millions and millions of people, whereas the Democrats are down 30 percent, 35 percent. They're down from what they were. We're up by 50 percent and even more than that. You're talking about millions of people. So I actually think it's the biggest story in politics today. And I hope that the Republicans will embrace it. We have -- don't forget, we have Democrats coming over, very importantly. We have independents coming over and they haven't done that ever, probably ever. And with all of these people coming over, we're going to have something very, very special.

If win and if I get to go against Hillary, polls are showing that I beat her. And some of the polls have me beating her very easily because when you take advantage -- we will take many, many people away from the Democrats and we'll take many, many people away that normally go Democrat as independents, and we're seeing that. We're seeing that. We had people come over here who have never voted Republican, who have never even thought about it, and they came and they voted Republican.

And I'll tell you another group of people that I've seen -- and I'll be signing autographs after a speech and will be talking to people and I've had many, many people say -- and it was a beautiful thing to hear it -- Mr. Trump, I'm 67 years old -- many people -- I'm 67 years old. I've never, ever voted before. I've never come close to voting before. This is the first time I'll ever vote. And that's so amazing. It's so amazing.

(APPLAUSE)

And they do it with such spirit. So it's really great.

I want to thank the special interests and the lobbyists because -- (LAUGHTER) -- they obviously did something to drive these numbers. I mean, we're close to 50 percent and 40 percent. No, I'm -- but I want to congratulate them because to raise that much money that quickly is a pretty good feat, right? Do we agree? No, many of them are my friends but they just have to gamble, you know? They have to do it.

I want to thank Paul Ryan. He called me a couple of days ago. He could not have been nicer. He was very encouraging and I have great respect for Paul Ryan, great respect.

(APPLAUSE)

Ted Cruz is interesting because he's always -- I mean, he's always saying I'm the only one that can beat Donald Trump. You have to vote for Donald Trump and you're going to vote for Donald Trump and you're going to be miserable. You have to vote for me. But he's the only one that can beat Donald Trump and I've heard it so many times. And I said but he never beats me? (LAUGHTER) I mean, take a look, he never beats me, meaning he rarely beats me. The fact is that we're going to do well. Ted is going to have a hard time -- when he gets to certain states, he's going to have a hard time.

One of the things we do is we get up to New York, I'm going to do great. We get to New Jersey, I'm going to do great. Chris Christie is here some place and -- the governor of New Jersey, great prosecutor. I watched what he did to Marco. Where is Chris? He's around here somewhere.

(APPLAUSE)

And great prosecutor and he's -- and really when he came and called and he said I've seen this, it's an amazing thing, it's a movement. Many people have called it a movement, I mean, four covers in the last three and a half months on Time Magazine. I mean, many people have called it a movement, and part of that movement's what I said before. I mean, it's the people want to be involved.

So when Chris called and when Sarah Palin called and when Jerry Falwell, Jr. called and when Joe Arpaio called -- I mean, you know when Joe Arpaio of Arizona calls that Trump is tough on the border, OK? And I don't want to be tough. I want to be fair but we're going to be -- we're going to have borders again, folks. We're going to have borders. We're going to have the wall. We're going to have borders. And people are going to come to the country and they're going to come into the country and they're going to be very happy, but they're coming in legally. They have to come in legally.

(APPLAUSE)

Mitt Romney got up and made a speech the other day. No, it's OK. (BOOS) No, no, I understood. No, no, he's a very nice man. LAUGHTER But you know, I understand. Look, it's hard. When you go through this and then you get to the final gate and you don't get over it, it's a hard thing. I mean -- so I understand. But he did make some statements. And I brought some things up because he said water company is gone. I said, it is? I didn't know that. I have very successful companies. Let me just expound. I'm going to do this in about two seconds but I filed with the federal elections, 100 pages, almost 100 pages that many of the press have gone down and seen, and they were all very, very impressed. I built a great, great company. I have very low debt. I have assets like this, this is owned 100 percent by me with no debt.

(APPLAUSE)

You've seen Mar-A-Lago. You've seen -- and that's a 100 percent by me with no debt. I have Trump International, where you were last week; 100 percent by me and no debt. You look at Doral, where we just had the major championship -- I mean, I have a lot of things in Florida, partners with related or numerous jobs on the beach, very successful, partners with Gil and Michael Dezer on the beach, massive buildings. Nobody ever talks about this stuff. And you know, many, many jobs in New York, including the city on the west side from 72nd to 59th street, or on the Hudson River, one of the most successful projects ever built in real estate. The Bank of America building, a big chunk of it, in San Francisco, 1290 Avenue there -- many, many things.

And Mitt got up -- and he really shouldn't have done it, it wasn't becoming, honestly -- and he talked about the water company. Well, there's the water company. I mean, we sell water and we have water and it's a very successful -- you know it's a private little water company and I supply the water for all my places and it's good -- but it's very good.

Trump steaks -- where are the steaks? Do we have steaks? We have Trump steaks. He said the steak company, and we have Trump steaks. And by the way, if you want to take one, we'll charge you about, what, 50 bucks a steak? No, I'm only -- (LAUGHTER).

We have Trump Magazine. Let me see the magazine.

(APPLAUSE)

He said Trump Magazine is out. I said, it is? I thought I read one two days ago. This comes out and it's called The Jewel of Palm Beach and we -- it goes to all of my clubs. I've had it for many years and it's the magazine. It's great. Anybody want one? Here, take one, my club champion.

So -- and the airline, by the way, I sold the airline. You know, he said Trump Airline. Well, I sold the airline and I actually made a great deal, complicated and in really terrible times. The economy was horrible and I made a phenomenal deal. I had the shuttle and I sold it. I made -- you know, so I'm hearing about all of these things.

And by the way, Trump University, it's -- we're holding it. When I win the lawsuit, which I'll win, the -- they did an ad -- Rubio did an ad the other day. He had two or three people and the three people were saying, oh, it was so terrible, it was -- the reason I didn't settle every one of these people -- in fact, we sent them out and the reporters don't like to report it but we sent their letters out, their report cards. Their report cards were all excellent, beautiful statements. We love it. You can't settle cases when the person suing you has given you letters, and in some cases tapes, saying how great it is. It was a very nice thing. So we're putting it on hold. If I become president, that means Ivanka, Don, Eric and my family will start it up. But we have a lot of great people who want to get back into Trump University. It's going to do very well and it will continue to do very well. But we have a lawsuit where they're trying to get -- you know, we have one of these class-action lawyers guys and it's ridiculous. But we'll win that lawsuit.

And I'm -- I just want to explain. I -- and the United States should be this -- I don't settle lawsuits, very rare, because once you settle lawsuits, everybody sues you, very simple. It's like business. I teach it. When you settle lawsuits -- it's easy to settle, sometimes it's cheaper to settle, but once you settle -- I had a friend taught me a long time ago, he was sued very rarely and everybody else in the same business was sued all the time. He said, Donald, I never settle. The lawyers learn you don't settle, they don't sue. So I don't settle lawsuits. When I watch these banks, they're settling lawsuits all the time. They get paid $40 million a year, a banker, and then he settles lawsuits with governments and other people, giving billions and billions of dollars. I don't do it.

So when I saw the different things -- and by the way, the winery, you see the wine, because he mentioned Trump vodka, it's the largest winery on the East Coast. I own it 100 percent, no mortgage, no debt. You can all check. You have to go check the records, folks. In fact, the press, I'm asking you, please check because you can see if there's any debt. It was the Kluge estate, John Kluge. He was the richest man in the United States. He died and he built one of the great vineyards of all time. I mean, there is nothing like it, close to 2,000 acres. It's in Charlottesville, Virginia, right next to the Thomas Jefferson Memorial, and we're very proud of it. We make the finest wine, as good a wine as you can get anywhere in the world. And I know the press is extremely honest so I won't offer them any, but if they want they can take a bottle of wine home. The members -- the members have plenty, right? The members have plenty. But we have one of the greatest -- actually, I believe it's the largest vineyard and the largest winery on the East Coast.

And so I just want to -- so I want to put that to rest. So you have the water, you have the steaks, you have the airline that I sold. I mean, what's wrong with selling? Every once in a while you can sell something. You have the wines and all of that, and Trump University, we're going to start it up as soon as I win the lawsuit. Does that make sense? I mean, that's it. OK.

(APPLAUSE)

The -- and I want to thank my friend, Paul O'Neill, because that, to me, is a big deal. I had such respect. When Paul was a Yankee, he just didn't make mistakes, tough, smart. We could use him right now. And he just didn't make mistakes. I love that kind of a guy.

(APPLAUSE)

I think what this shows, really more than anything else, is that advertising is not as important, it really isn't as important as competence, because there has never been more money spent on hitting somebody than was spent on me. And between that and people saying things and, you know, Lindsey Graham goes and he's a nasty person. First of all, he's wrong on the military, he -- truly. This is why he's -- he said I've been doing this for 15 years. That's right, we've been fighting a war for 15 years with this kind of thinking. I mean, if you're going to fight a war, win the war and let's get back to rebuilding our country, OK?

(APPLAUSE)

But Lindsey Graham, I mean, he's been so nasty. I think he's probably a nice guy but he's been so nasty. I watch him, I say, man, does he hate Donald Trump. And I watch him and, you know, if you think about it, every single person that's attacked me has gone down, OK? I don't want to mention names. Let's not mention names, OK? They're out, they're gone. But you can take a look at virtually every single person. We started off with 17; we're down to four. Of the four, they're pretty much all gone, OK, pretty much. They didn't do so well tonight, folks, OK? I'm not going to say anybody didn't do well. They didn't do well. There's only one person did well tonight; Donald Trump, I will tell you, it's true.

(APPLAUSE)

I mean, it -- it was actually amazing. I was impressed. And even Megyn Kelly said, boy, Donald Trump really did well tonight. Thank you, Megyn.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you. That was a very unusual -- I was shocked, actually, to hear that, but that was very nice. And Charles Krauthammer said that. He was very, very nice. Thank you, Charles. It's about time. I've been waiting like five years, Charles.

But it is true. I mean, every single -- we -- I have had such hostility. Like with Lindsey, he was at 7 percent. He attacked me and we took him down to zero. He leaves in disgrace. He then goes to his own state and they do a poll in South Carolina. He endorses somebody else. And the poll in South Carolina has me at 47 percent and him at 2 percent, and he's a sitting senator. And then we went down from there. And you know what? I don't like to bring it up but I tell you, it's enough, Lindsey. Just relax, go home. Relax for a little while. Everyone knows you take this big defeat.

And the problem is the press never calls them out. They go to this horrible defeat and then they go and they start immediately on the attack and it's like he never ran and made a fool out of himself. You know, at what point do you call people out? So I call people out. But it is true. They're attacked me very viciously and every single one who's attacked me is gone and I'm very proud of that because --

(APPLAUSE)

-- because that's what we should have for our country. That's what we should have. ISIS should not be beating us. We don't win anymore. We don't win with our military. We don't win with health care. We don't win with anything. And we shouldn't be in a position where ISIS is dictating terms.

And you know, the other day at one of the debates, the one before last, they asked Ted -- Lyin' Ted -- I call him Lyin' Ted. He holds the Bible high and then he goes down, he puts the Bible down and then he lies, Lyin' Ted. You know, he -- he'll say I'm the only one that beat Donald Trump. I said that before. I beat him. I beat him. But he doesn't say, yeah, he won, like, four and I won, like, 12 or 13, right? He forgets the other part. But Lyin' Ted -- and you know, when they say the evangelicals -- because in watching -- in fact, I was watching Carl and they said how great I did with the evangelicals and everyone was a little surprised. I'm a very good Christian. And you know, they're chipping away at Christianity and we're not going to let that happen anymore, folks. I tell you --

(APPLAUSE)

And a lot of times I'll say at the rallies around Christmastime, we're going to start saying Merry Christmas again. You know, they don't say it anymore. The department stores don't put it up. We're going to start saying it again. But they're chipping away at Christianity and we just can't do it. And I'll tell you, with the evangelicals, they get it. They get it. They get me. They understand me. I'll be the best thing that ever happened to them. I mean that 100 percent. And they don't like the way Ted talks and they don't like the fact that he truly does lie. And I actually was -- I mean, lies badly.

And I was actually, interestingly, little Marco helped me a lot. (LAUGHTER) Marco -- what Marco did is in one of the debates, he screamed across me -- I was -- I've been in the center from the beginning, right? Never out of center. In fact, I always like an odd number because with the odd number I'm in the center. With an even number, like last week, I hated it because we had four people, so I'm not in the center. So we should always keep it odd numbers, right, so we're right in the center. But I've been in the center for every single debate.

But Marco helped me a lot because he called Ted a liar. He said, you're a liar. That's the first time. Look, I know politicians better than anybody. They're liars, OK? They're serious liars. More importantly, they'll never get you to the Promised Land, ever. They'll never get you to the Promised Land. They won't do it because they're controlled by the special interests. They're controlled by the people that put up all this money for them to run. They're controlled -- do you know how much money was spent in the last week on me?

And do you know how many times they were asking, despite the fact that they're not supposed to be talking to their super PAC, Carl, fellows, let me ask you a question. How many times do you think Marco and Ted and all of them were calling their super PAC? Is that right? It's called life. That's the way life works. They talk to their super PAC. They're not supposed to but that's the way life works.

So we are going to do something. I think we're going to clean the slate. I think we're going to do really well in Florida. It's my second home. I love Florida. I love Florida.

(APPLAUSE)

I love Florida. It's a special place and I think we're going to do really well.

I think we're going to do really well in Ohio. Now that I have Paul O'Neill's endorsement, I know I'm going to win Ohio. But I love Ohio. I have so many friends in Ohio. It's an amazing place and we're going to go and have a lot of fun. And then what we're going to do is we're going to beat Hillary Clinton and we're going to beat her badly.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to beat her badly. And I think one of the things -- and then we'll take some questions -- but one of the things that really I add that's very different -- you know, we always talk about the five and sometimes six, but the five states that you have to get, whether it's Ohio or Pennsylvania or Florida, you know, if you don't get one -- because the Republicans, structurally it's much tougher. It's much tougher for a Republican to win the presidency, like by a factor of five. But I add things that nobody else can do. I have a chance of New York. Now can you imagine if you won a state as big as New York, all of those delegates? Upstate New York, I poll higher than anybody ever because they are really in trouble up there and they know that I would've done things -- they wouldn't be in trouble right now if they would've taken my advice, but they're really in trouble.

But I'll get -- I'll get Michigan. I mean, I'm going to get Michigan because we're going to bring the car industry back. We're going to take it back. We're going to bring the car industry back into Michigan. I'm going to win Michigan. It's never even a question. When these candidates are talking about running, it's never even a question. Michigan's not something they even talk about.

I'll win New Jersey. I'll win Ohio. I'll win Florida. I'll win Virginia. I have great properties in Virginia. Charlottesville, we just talked, winery. On the Potomac River, we have one of the great places in the world. I have 600 acres on the Potomac River, one of the great pieces of property in the world, very, very successful place. I have, you know, I have a lot of employees in Virginia. And it seems that when I have something in a location, like when I'm in Virginia and I have a lot of employees, I have great places, Florida where I have Doral -- Doral was great last week with Adam Scott, I mean, two days ago Adam Scott. How good was that?

(APPLAUSE)

He's a great young man and the way he won the tournament, the Cadillac World Championship. But when you have property in a state, it means you love the state. It means you have a lot of employees. You pay these employees. You take care of their health care. You take care of their education for their families. You take care of so many things and you just do well.

So I think I'm going to do great there and I think I'm going to do great in Ohio, and I really look forward to it. I'm going to be working very hard between the two.

And Illinois, I mean, I have one of the greatest building in the world. I mean, Chicago, I have one of the greatest buildings, rated the number one hotel in North America and I'm very proud of it. It's a great, great -- right on the river and it's a great, great building and maybe that's where we have our next news conference and, you know, maybe we'll do it right in Chicago.

So let's see what the press has to ask and we'll then go home and we'll go celebrate a lot of victories.

Yes, go ahead, CBS.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: No, I don't really because you have to win. I know how to win. I've won -- these people will tell you. Have I won many club championships? Stand up. Stand up. Stand up.

(APPLAUSE)

Have I won many club championships? Does Trump know how to close? You know, believe it or not, it's not so different. Winning is winning. You've got to be -- it's not easy to win club championships, believe me. And I'm not talking with strokes. I'm talking with no strokes. But the fact is I like to close -- I like to close things out.

So until the last person is gone -- again, we started with a field of 17 and now we're down to four and I really want to close things out. I don't want to start thinking in terms -- I have not even focused on Hillary yet. I'm doing well. Numerous polls have me winning, but I haven't even started with her, other than four weeks ago when I actually hit her very hard because what she said was wrong.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, there are many cases, I mean, many cases. The case -- I have all night, OK? (LAUGHTER) I mean, you'd have to -- you'd have to go on for hours. Hillary is going to be very easy to beat. She's a very flawed candidate, very, very flawed candidate and it's going to be -- I believe it's going to be a very, very easy target, if she's allowed to run because there's a real question as to whether or not she's even going to be allowed to run. And if the government is going to do its job properly, she will not be allowed to run.

(APPLAUSE)

OK. Go ahead, Tom.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I have no message to Marco. I think that, you know, he has to make his own -- you know, it's been a tough night for him but he's going to make his own decision. I've actually had a good relationship with Marco, believe it or not. He became hostile about two weeks ago and it didn't work. See, hostility works for some people. It doesn't work for everybody, OK?

(APPLAUSE, LAUGHTER)

No, but he became very hostile and, you know what, it doesn't work for him. He was better -- we would've been better off had he kept the original pitter-patter going, but this didn't work.

Say it, Tom, a little louder.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I've been outspent by everybody. I mean, part of the beauty -- look, I have much more money than all of them put together times 20, OK? But I'm a businessman. I don't have to spend. Why should I spend the money? I've spent probably $25 million or $30 million. Other people have spent $160 million. You know, you have the numbers. In New Hampshire, as an example, I spent $1 and a half million and somebody else spent $48 million. I was one, the other person was number five. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a country that worked that way, right -- right?

(APPLAUSE)

So -- so the CNN poll came out and I was 41 percent. In fact, I was 49 percent and second is 15 percent -- 15 percent and 15 percent. And you know, and I've spent less money than anybody else.

Now, the phony Wall Street Journal polls just came out, where I'm still number one but that poll -- if you remember the poll from South Carolina, the Wall Street Journal/NBC poll was the phoniest, most disgusting poll I've ever seen, OK? I don't believe that poll and I don't know who's making up that poll but they should not pay their bill. You know, I don't do that. People say, oh, Donald Trump doesn't pay the bill. That's true. I never pay bills when somebody does a bad job. They did such a bad job during the South Carolina run. They had me practically dying in South Carolina the day before. I mean, they did that with viciousness and vindictiveness, and it looked like I was really in trouble. And then I won in a landslide. The poll was wrong. And then the following day, they came out with a national poll that was ridiculous too. So they came out with another one, NBC, Chuck Todd, NBC/Wall Street Journal. I'm saying what's wrong with them? It's not right. Now CNN came out with a poll; 49 percent a couple of days ago. They came out with a poll; 30 percent. Again, I'm still in first place but I really believe their poll is wrong. And boy, did they turn out to be wrong in South Carolina, OK?

Yeah, go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: Mr. Trump, there's a new blistering ad out in the state of Florida, of course, (INAUDIBLE) Super Tuesday, that accuses you of being un-presidential. In 30 seconds, they have nine examples of you swearing on the campaign trail, using the "A" word, the "S" word, the "D" word, the "F" word. Is that presidential? Are you embarrassed by --

DONALD TRUMP: I'll be honest with you, I saw it. I was a little concerned with that ad until I saw it. I think it's better than any ad I've ever taken for myself. I do. (LAUGHTER) You know why? Let me just tell you why. No, I really mean it. I really mean it. I heard about the ad and I said, oh, I'm not going to like this. But when I looked at it -- and I can be -- by the way, I can be more presidential than anybody. I can be more presidential if I want to be. I can be more presidential than anybody. You know, when I have 16 people coming at me from 16 different angles, you don't want to be so presidential. You have to win. You have to beat them back, right? And -- but I would say more presidential -- and I've said this a couple of times -- more presidential than anybody other than the great Abe Lincoln. He was very presidential, right?

But the truth is that I saw that ad and people are sick and tired of being politically correct and I actually think that ad is good for me because --

(APPLAUSE)

In some cases, as you know, I was kidding and I was joking. I have a big audience and I was joking, with words not so bad, by the way, but I was joking. In other cases, I was showing anger and showing a certain toughness that we need in our country. But I watched that ad and I said, you know, that ad shows a certain degree of anger, and it shows a certain degree, like, we're not going to take it anymore from all of these countries that have been ripping us off and taking our jobs and taking our money like we're a bunch of babies -- very, very stupid babies. So I watched that ad and I don't think it's a bad ad for me. I actually think if I had my choice of saying I could have it down or let it run, let it run.

(APPLAUSE)

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Say it again?

UNIDENTIFIED: A lot of parents are trying to figure out how to explain some of the language they're hearing on the TV.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, you're so politically correct. You're so beautiful, look at you. Ahh. Ahh, he's so -- oh, I know, you've never heard a little bad -- a little off language. I know, you're so perfect. Aren't you perfect? Aren't you just a perfect young man? Give me -- hey, give me break. You know what? It's stuff like that that people in this country are tired of, OK? It's stuff like that.

Sarah?

(APPLAUSE)

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Say it again, Sarah, a little louder.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, maybe at some point they will. But look, I hear $39 million has been spent. I'll be honest with you, I'm very surprised. I looked at the numbers. In Mississippi, I'm close to 50 percent. That's not 50 percent with two people. That's 50 percent with four people. That's a lot. That's shocking. That's like record-setting. Big difference, you know, if you're running, like, you're Hillary and you're running against one guy, I mean, you're running against Bernie, OK? (LAUGHTER) And you get a 50 percent or a 52 percent or a 56 percent. That's -- I'm running against three very competent people and I'm getting 50 percent and in Michigan I'm close to 40 percent, against a big group of people.

I think that -- I will say this. I am a little bit surprised that -- I was at Doral and I was watching, and I was watching Adam Scott hit that last great shot. And I went back and I was watching the news in one of the rooms and every single advertisement was about me, and it was during my tournament. I'm turning my tournament -- I go from tournament to horrible ad. Every -- the most vicious ads.

I mean, one of the reasons I brought the wine out and the water out and the steak out, and more wine and more water, and I told you about Trump University, well, we'll win that case. That's going to be an easy case to win. Everybody signed a document. One of the reasons is just because of that. They hit me with this Trump University. It's not even a big case. It's -- we're going to win the case. I could settle that case so easily. I don't want to settle it. It would be easier for me to settle it. I wouldn't have all you people writing about it, but I don't want to settle it. I could settle it so easy.

The fact is that, look, you have to do in life, Sarah, you have to do what's right. And if you live by principle, and believe it or not, I'm a very highly-principled person. If you live by principle, you're going to do very well.

(APPLAUSE)

But I -- just to finish, I must tell you, I was a little surprised when I saw the viciousness of the ads, and the viciousness of really -- Mitt was very vicious. I mean, he gets up and he just -- I wish he used that same energy against Obama. I think he would've won.

(APPLAUSE)

No, no, if he used the same energy against Obama, he would've won.

Carl?

UNIDENTIFIED: Given your statement to Major about how easy it would be to beat Hillary Clinton, do you agree that you're going to need to get mainstream American Republican politics, the establishment, as it's been labeled, behind you? And if so, what do you say to them tonight, given so many of them are pouring their money into trying to beat you?

DONALD TRUMP: I say let's come together, folks. We're going to win. I say let's come together.

(APPLAUSE)

Carl, the answer is not 100 percent but largely I would say yes. You know, some people you're just not going to get along with. It's OK. But largely, I would like to do that. And believe it or not, I am a unifier. I unify. I mean, you look at all of the things I built all over the world, I'm a unifier. I get along with people. I have great relations. I even started getting along with you, right, Campaign Carl? But no, I get along with people. And I really say this, Carl, I think it's time to unify.

We have something special going on, the Republican Party, and unfortunately, the people in the party, they call them the elites, or whatever they call them, but those are the people that don't respect it yet. We have millions and millions of people -- I discussed it before -- we have millions and millions of people coming up and voting, largely for me, in all fairness, but for other people also. And Carl, you know this because I've seen you report on it. It's a record. It's a record. It's never happened before in 100 years what's happening now to the Republican Party, has never happened before.

And the people in the party, whether you call them establishment or not, you can call them anything. I don't know if there is such a thing as the establishment, frankly. But whether you call them the establishment or not, they should embrace it. They should -- you know, the Democrats would love to have what's happening. I have friends on the other side. They say, boy, would we like that to happen. You know, Carl, they're down 35 percent. There's no spirit there. Whereas we're way up with millions of people. So what I say to the Republicans is embrace it. We will win the election easily.

(APPLAUSE)

UNIDENTIFIED: As you've just described, Mitt Romney and Lindsey Graham, in your words, have been attacking you viciously. And how can you win them back? And do you think they're necessary? Or --

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know that you have to win everybody, Carl.

UNIDENTIFIED: When you say that there's a different -- something that hasn't happened in 100 years, are you changing the Republican Party? Are you reforming the Republican Party? And if so, how do you assure conservatives that it's not in the wrong direction and they're right?

DONALD TRUMP: OK, let's talk about that because it's so interesting. I'm not really changing the Republican Party because I'm actually a conservative, but I'm a common-sense conservative. Look, nobody's more conservative than me on energy independence, OK? I've been talking about it for years -- nobody. Nobody's more conservative than me on the military. Nobody's more conservative than me on taking care of our great veterans who are being absolutely maligned.

(APPLAUSE)

Nobody's more conservative than me on health care, where we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare, and on common core, where we're getting rid of it, and on budgets, where whether it's the penny deal, there are so many different things but we'll straighten out our budgets. Carl, we owe $19 trillion. We're going to start paying off debt. And we're not going to pay it all off that quickly, and nor do we have to, but we have to start bringing it down to a level that's sustainable because we're going in the wrong direction. So -- and certainly nobody is more conservative than me on the border.

The one thing I guess people could say is that on trade, I am a free-trader, believe it or not, but I'm also a smart trader. We cannot let China -- and I like China. They're wonderful. But their leaders are too smart for our leaders. I like China. I do great with China. The Bank of America building, other buildings I have because of China, in a war we fought. But I will tell you nobody -- nobody is more conservative, actually, on trade.

The problem I have is you have people that are in National Review, and they're eggheads, they're eggheads. They just have no common sense whatsoever, no common sense whatsoever. It's not free trade when China charges tax to get our product in and they don't let our product in anyway, and yet they take their product and they just send it to us like nothing.

We have a trade deficit of China of $500 billion a year. We have a trade deficit with Japan of over $100 billion a year. We have a trade deficit with Mexico. That's why Mexico's going to pay for the wall. Fifty-eight billion dollars a year -- 100 percent. It's 100 percent. You know, these guys come up that I'm against and they say you're not going to get Mexico to pay for the wall. I said of course I am. We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. The wall's going to cost $10 billion. You tell me I can't make that deal? That's an easy deal.

(APPLAUSE)

So the only thing, Carl, because I love the question, but the only thing I can say that some people would say I'm not conservative is trade, but that's because I want fair trade, OK? I want free trade, but free trade you have to have smart people on both sides and we don't have smart people on our side.

So I want fair trade. It's got to be fair trade, or as you would say, fair and balanced trade, OK, as they would say at Fox.

OK, Jeremy, go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: I actually want to ask you about trade. So staying on that topic, that's kind of one of the key planks of your campaign, has been this idea of fair trade.

DONALD TRUMP: Very important.

UNIDENTIFIED: You talked about how the U.S. is getting killed by countries like China and Mexico, and just now you talked about --

DONALD TRUMP: Destroyed, destroyed.

UNIDENTIFIED: That's right. But of course, there is -- there are some benefits to free trade in the U.S. American consumers benefit from cheaper goods, for example. If you increase tariffs, these 35 percent tariffs on countries like China --

(CROSS-TALK)

DONALD TRUMP: You know what? OK, I know what you're going to say, Jeremy. Let me just --

UNIDENTIFIED: Let me finish my question.

DONALD TRUMP: I can't because nobody's listening to you, Jeremy, OK? Nobody ever listens to you.

Let me just explain. The problem that we have with trade, Jeremy -- Jeremy, let me just tell you -- is we have people on the other side that are grandmasters at monetary manipulation, at currency manipulation. They're manipulating their currency to such an extent that our companies cannot compete with other companies in other nations. They just can't compete. And because of that, we're losing our jobs.

If you take a look at home many jobs China, as an example, has taken from us -- but it's not just China; it's everybody. China is the big abusers because it's the biggest. China has taken millions of jobs, thousands of factories. What they've done to us, it's actually, I thought about it the other day, it's the greatest theft in the history of the world. They've taken out so much money. And again, I love China, it's great. And I don't hold anything against their leaders. I wish our leaders would do the same thing in reverse but they don't.

And we cannot continue -- hey look, I won Michigan and I went up there and these people are incredible people. You take a look at some of the -- some of the factories that have been abandoned there, where they moved into Mexico. You take a look at, as an example, in Chicago where you have Nabisco moves its big plant -- they're closing their plant. They're moving to Mexico. Ford, building a $2 and a half billion factory, cars, in Mexico. I mean, we can't continue to do it. Carrier -- two weeks ago Carrier announced they're going to close, 1,400 people laid off. They're going to build air conditioners -- they're going to put their air conditioners in Mexico. They're going to build them in Mexico. How does that help us?

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, sure. OK, no. No. You know what's going to happen, Jeremy? Let me tell you what's going to happen, OK? Can I tell you what's going to happen? When China thinks you mean it -- when they think you mean it, they're going to stop manipulating their currency and you won't even have to do anything, and you might even have free trade, OK?

(APPLAUSE)

You didn't hear me. When China thinks you mean it, when Japan thinks you mean it, that we're not going to let them sell the cars like that because they're killing us -- you know what we sell to Japan? Practically nothing. They have cars coming in by the millions and we sell practically nothing. When Japan thinks we mean it and they'll stop playing around with the yen. They're almost as good as China.

You look at what's happening with Komatsu tractor and you look at what's happening with Caterpillar, and Caterpillar is being hurt very badly by Komatsu, not because their machines aren't -- but Caterpillar makes a better machine. But because of the fact that they currency manipulate and we can't have that. And they're not supposed to do it but they have no fear of our government. They're dealing with babies. We're dealing with babies, OK? They are grandmaster players and we have people that shouldn't be negotiating for us, all right? We shouldn't.

All right, one more question. Go ahead. Let's see if she'll finally give me a decent -- after 12 years. I'm not going to finish with her because she never asks a decent question. OK, go ahead. I'm only kidding. Go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: That's right.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't know. I'm going to say -- you know what? Lindsey Graham's probably a nice guy and I was very tough on him because he was tough on me, but I think he's probably a nice guy. I think I could probably get along with Lindsey Graham.

I could probably get along with Mitt Romney. I mean, I have nothing against Mitt Romney and I understand how he feels. I mean, he worked really hard -- should've worked a little harder -- but he worked really hard and he didn't get there. I mean, I understand it. I could probably get along with Mitt Romney. I could probably -- I don't know Mitt Romney very well. I endorsed him, I backed him, I helped him, but I don't really know Mitt Romney.

I could probably get along very well with Lindsey Graham but he goes on television, he's very nasty. And when they're nasty, you have to be nasty back. I can get along with people.

Look, the bottom line is we have something going that's so good. We should grad each other and we should unify the party and nobody's going to beat us, OK?

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you very much everybody. Thank you, I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

(APPLAUSE)
