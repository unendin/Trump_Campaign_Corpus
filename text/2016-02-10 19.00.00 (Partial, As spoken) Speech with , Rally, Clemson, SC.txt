DONALD TRUMP: Cold in here, huh? Where are the heaters? Where are the heaters?

Well, you know, I'll tell you what. The Clemson Tigers -- I was watching that game, but next year, all the way. Great team. Great team.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Great team. It was some game, you have to say, a little bit better than the Super Bowl, don't we agree?

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

A lot better, but -- well, thank you very much. This is some crowd. Wow.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

What the hell kind of a building is this? What is this? It's beautiful, a little bit on the cold side. I don't usually do this. But I figure (INAUDIBLE)

Well, it's great to be with you. And you know, we've had an exciting time. We did a good thing. New Hampshire, what a great place. What a great place.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And we won it big. We won it big. You know, the networks, they called, they said, We're going to be announcing at 8:00 o'clock. 8:00 o'clock is when the final vote is cast. And I said, I think that's a good thing. I hope that's, like, for us. And we won by a lot, a really lot.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And the reason is that people are tired of losing in this country. We're losing all the time. People are tired of stupidity, incompetence. We're not going to have it anymore. We're not going to have it.

And you know, we had a case where somebody was talking about the anger that they think I have. I'm not an angry person. You're not angry. But we're angry about the way our country is run. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to let it happen.

So this has been going on, and we went up to New Hampshire. I know, it was an amazing experience actually because I've known it long and for a long time, many friends live in New Hampshire. Many friends live here, by the way, I have to tell you. But many friends up in New Hampshire.

And it came out -- and the original polls came out and they were so high. By the way, the original polls which just came out here, we're through the roof. We are high.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

We are high. I mean, the problem you have -- and I saw it up there, and yet people are smart. These politicians, they say anything. They say- like, I'm very, very big on the 2nd Amendment. I think most people know that, very, very big.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And they'll say, Donald Trump does not respect the 2nd amendment. I say, What the hell is this guy talking about? The lying is unbelievable! And I guess it's part of a process, but the good thing -- we have a big, beautiful microphone.

yes, sit down. Relax. Sit down. We'll be here as long as you want. And we may take some questions. Should we take some questions?

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I think so. I think so. Let's just have a good time.

You know, I got so far in the last, like, couple of days -- one hour sleep because, you know, when you have victory, you don't need sleep, right? You're going on adrenaline.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And then what happens is the following day, you say, Maybe I do need sleep after all. So somebody said, Oh, that's not a problem, Mr. Trump. We could cancel this or postpone it. I said, Are you crazy? I would never -- this is my -- look, this is our group. We have something so special going on. We have something so special going on. The cover of "Time" magazine last week, they're talking about it's a movement. It's a movement to take our country back. And it is. It's a movement to take our country back.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And that's what we're doing. And it's going to be so beautiful. And it's started. It actually started with Iowa. We did great in Iowa. We did great in Iowa. Had Dr. Carson been allowed to keep his votes, we would have done even better. But we did great.

You started off with 17 people on the Republican side. You know a couple just dropped out today. Do you know that? Do you know who? Carly and Christie.

And so we're down to -- you know, we're getting down to pretty good numbers here. We're getting down to low numbers. When I did it -- and I said -- it was June 16th, and it takes guts. I always say to everybody, it takes guts to run for president. Not easy. Not easy.

And especially -- you know, when you're successful person -- I've always heard it. If you're very a successful person, the last thing you do is run for office. And I never really sort of understood that. There's a certain legitimacy to what you do, and then you get into politics, it's a whole other world. I've been in politics all my life, but I've been on the other (PH). You know, I've been a supporter.

But I think nobody knows it better than me. And one of the things we're doing and one of the things I'm doing is I'm self-funding my campaign, so I can't be bought.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I can't be bought by all these people. And I think it's appreciated. But you know, I turned down -- I'll tell you, you have a guy like Bush, who has this big fund.

(BOOS)

It's terrible. I'll be honest, the last thing we need is another Bush. That I can tell you. That I can tell you.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

This guy, he says anything that's on his mind. But you know, he's gotten so much money -- here's a statistic just came out. In New Hampshire, he spent $39 million, and what is he, fourth or fifth, right? Think of it, $39 million -- look at all these people standing. This place is unbelievable. The place is massive. Look at all these people.

He spent be -- I love you, too. Look at this, these people.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

This country is so great. The people in this country are so amazing. And you know, all the time, no matter where I go, it's the same. I go to Mobile, Alabama, 35,000 people. We go to Dallas, 20,000, 21,000 people. We go to Oklahoma, 20,000 people.

In New Hampshire -- I'll tell you what. New Hampshire, we were packed all the time. We had in a blizzard, a blizzard, 5,000 people in an arena, the Verizon arena, so beautiful. It was incredible. Three of my people were in car accidents coming over.

One of them walked over about a mile through a blizzard to be there, and it turned out he had close to a broken leg. And then I said, You're fired for ruining my car. No, I'm only kidding.

(LAUGHTER)

Why not? But the people, like, they have such spirit, such beautiful spirit (INAUDIBLE) so I felt it was very important to self-fund because I think nobody knows the system better than me. And guys are getting all of this money.

And I would have had more than anybody. I mean, I was turning down friends, people that I know, $5 million, $10 million, people would give me anything. And they put them in these PACs, which are as crooked as hell. They're horrible. They're horrible. No, they're horrible. And the PAcs aren't supposed to be running the campaigns, but they're running the campaigns. They're running the campaigns. You know, they're totally -- it's out of -- I'll be honest, it's out of control.

But it's hard for me, you know because my whole life, I take money, right? I make money. Like some of us who are in business, we make money, we grab money, money, money. I love money, right? No, it's true. And we get greedy and more and more.

And then, all of a sudden, it's, like, I say, No, I don't want it. I want to do something else. I want to be greedy, but I want to be greedy for the United States. We want to bring money into the United States.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I really do. I really do. The hell with the business stuff. My kids will take the business. My executives, they'll run it. We built a great business. I built an incredible business, some of the greatest assets in the world, very little debt, tremendous cash flow, just a great business.

And frankly, you know, Doral in Miami and Turnberry in Scotland, and so many different things, buildings in Manhattan, the Bank of America building in San Francisco, 1290 Avenue (PH) -- there are so many great things, and nobody knew that.

You know, when I -- because I'm a private person. So the pundits, the geniuses, they go and they say, Well, I don't think he's going to run. And I ran. They said they don't believe it. Then they said, He'll never file form A. Form A is a single piece of paper, you sign it, you're signing your life away.

Boy, there's so many beautiful people in this audience. I'm looking at this.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

These are good -- this is a good -- such a great-looking group of people.

But I say, Form A -- they say he'll never sign it. I signed it. Then they say, Well, you know, he'll never put in his financials because he's probably not as successful as people think. So all of the politicians, they'll do financials on one -- my financials were almost 100 pages long, done by the biggest accounting firms and lawyers in Washington. And I put them in.

They said, Well, he'll ask for extensions because you can have an extension forever. And I said, I don't want an extension, 30 days, boom, certified, done, put in. And they went -- and these characters -- look at all those cameras. Look at that. Look at it! No, take a look! Take a look back there. Is that incredible? Wow. Wow. Wow.

Do we have any protesters? Because if we had some protesters, they'll turn the cameras to the protesters. We may have to stage a phony protest. That's the only way they show the size of these crowds. This crowd is amazing.

I didn't know what the hell I was doing. I came here, I said, How many people? They said, I don't know, maybe about 10,000. This is an incredible thing.

So we go out and file the papers, and the company is incredible. And you know, frankly, the press reports were great, but they were looking for something else. The only reason I say that is that's the kind of thinking we need in the country. We have $19 trillion. It's a mess. We have China, Japan, Mexico, new one, Vietnam -- we have these countries absolutely killing us on trade.

With China, we have a trade deficit of $500 billion a year. Think of that. How the hell could have you $500 billion a year? You can't have it! Whoever heard of it? $500 billion a year. And it's been like that for a long time. They have been draining us.

I have the greatest business people in the world. They're dying to get involved. They don't want money. They don't want anything. They want to do it -- their ego. It's like chess players. They want to do it because the game is not fair. And we can't continue to go on like this. You see, the bubble is ready to pop. I don't know if you know, we're sitting on a very dangerous bubble, folks, just so you understand.

We are sitting -- and I have been very good at predicting markets, as you probably have heard. We're sitting on a very dangerous bubble. We're so tied into China, we're so tied into Asia. When they go bad, we go bad. And the whole thing is ridiculous.

And what we have is, we have a deficit with, as an example, Mexico. By the way, while we're talking about Mexico, Mexico is killing us on trade, but they're killing us at the border.

And guess what? We will build the wall. You know that.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

We will build the wall. We're going to build the wall.
