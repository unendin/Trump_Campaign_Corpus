DONALD TRUMP: Wow. This is so -- you get those teleprompters out of here. We're going to have some fun, right? Get those teleprompters -- we have a president.

You know our president, and I'm not talking about this president, I'm talking about that president -- we don't like those teleprompters.

I will say this, it's an honor to be here and especially on Martin Luther King Day. We broke the record. You know, we had the record for about three or four years the last time, and the first thing I said to Jerry and Becky when I got here, did we break the record?

They said, yes, you did, by quite a bit, so we'll dedicate that to Martin Luther King, a great man. And that's a little bit of an achievement, I will tell you.

(APPLAUSE)

It's an honor to be here. It's an amazing story, what's gone on with Liberty University. I mean, when you think of all of the years and the early years were not easy. I have read a lot about it, and I have watched it and Liberty University -- like a rocket ship, a really great rocket ship. And what Jerry has done, and I knew his father a little bit, and I have to tell you, I knew his father a lot from the standpoint of what he did. And to be compared to his father, just a little bit, to be compared to his father is really an honor for me. So, I want to thank Jerry for saying that.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, it was very interesting because when other candidates -- and everybody wants to come here. They don't have this kind of a crowd, but that's OK.

(LAUGHTER)

But I will say this. When Jerry was telling, you know, nice things about other people and he was saying this one is very smart and this one's good, this one's good, and Trump reminds me of my father, I said that's the best compliment of all. That's much better than any of the other people got. So I was extremely happy about that, I will tell you.

(LAUGHTER)

And you should be very proud to be here. You're going to have amazing futures. You're going to have just absolutely amazing futures.

We had a debate recently, and the debate -- who watched the debate? Everybody?

(APPLAUSE)

Very political place, OK? But it was an amazing evening for me, and we did fine, we did well. And the polls came out right after that, and we keep going up, and we're so happy. And I'm not going to go over the polls. Somebody said why do you always discuss the polls -- one of the people I'm running against -- why do you always...

Now, he's in seventh place, I'm in first place. I said when you're in first place, you discuss polls. It's true.

(APPLAUSE)

When you're in the first place, you discuss polls. But so many things have happened, and now, they just keep coming out and we go up and up and up. And we hit 42 last week. Forty-two percent, that's with 14 or 15 people. You know, they're dropping out rapidly, they're dropping out. When you have 42 percent, at least you know you're not totally wasting your time today, right? Forty-two percent is good.

(APPLAUSE)

I think I'd take 42 percent if we had three people, not 14. But it has been an experience, and NBC/Wall Street Journal just came out, 33 percent. And CBS and Owen -- let's see, 41 percent; CBS 35 percent; Gravis, 44 percent. We're really doing good, so I'm going to bother you. I will tell you in South Carolina, we're at 35 percent, way, way, way above anybody else. And in Iowa, CNN was -- we're at 33 (percent) to 20 (percent), so we're way up.

And actually, some other polls -- the closest is Iowa, and I love Iowa, and I'm going there right after this. Going up to New Hampshire, I'm going to Iowa. Because I want to win Iowa. Everyone says don't say that, don't say you're going to win, just say you're going to do well. That's the closest. But I can't do that.

You know, the safe way is to say well, I think I'm going to do well. I want to win Iowa. Let's see, we've done great...

(APPLAUSE)

... we've done great with the evangelicals; the evangelicals have been amazing, the Tea Party has been amazing. And we're doing really well there. So we'll see what happens, but we're going to give it our best and I think we could really surprise a lot of people by winning Iowa and then we're just going to clean the table. We're going to go through New Hampshire, through South Carolina where we were this weekend, and it was amazing. We're going to go right through the whole group, and I think we can do really something special.

And we're going to protect Christianity. And I can say that. I don't have to be politically correct or...

(APPLAUSE)

... we're going to protect it. You know -- and I -- I asked Jerry and I asked some of the folks, because I hear this is a major theme right here. But 2 Corinthians, right, 2 Corinthians 3:17. That's the whole ball game. "Where the spirit of the Lord " -- right? -- "Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." And here, there is Liberty College, but -- Liberty University. But it is so true.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, when you think -- and that's really -- is that the one? Is that the one you like? I think that's the one you like, because I loved it and it's so representative of what's taken place. But we are going to protect Christianity. And if you look what's going on throughout the world, you look at Syria where they're -- if you're Christian, they're chopping off heads. You look at the different places, and Christianity, it's under siege. I'm a Protestant, I'm very proud of it; Presbyterian to be exact. But I'm proud of it, very, very proud of it. And we've got to protect because bad things are happening, very, bad things are happening. And we don't -- I don't know what it is.

We don't band together. Maybe other religions, frankly, they're banning together and they're using it. Here we have -- if you look at this country, it's got to be 70 percent, 75 percent, some people say even more.

The power we have, somehow we have to unify. We have to band together. We have to do really, in a really large version, what they've done at Liberty. Because Liberty University has done that. You band together, you've created one of the great universities, colleges, anywhere in the country, anywhere in the world.

And that's what our country has to do that around Christianity. So get together, folks, and let's do it because we can do it.

(APPLAUSE)

No matter where I go, we're having tremendous crowds and we're setting records everywhere. We went to Dallas and the Mavericks Arena, packed, 20,000 people. Oklahoma, 20,000 people. Mobile, Alabama, 35,000 people. No matter where we go. It's only -- even here I understand you have rooms all over with the various equipment to show on the screens. You have a much better location than they do, but I won't tell them that. We're just cut that off.

(LAUGHTER)

But you have rooms all over with the media equipment, and no matter where we go, because I will tell you. this is a movement. It is a movement going on. We want to take our country back. Our country is disappearing. You look at the kind of deals we make. You look at what's happening, our country is going in the wrong direction and so wrong.

And it's got to be stopped and it's got to be stopped fast. We can't go another four years. I know that maybe Hillary will be here, and if she is, you can play this back, we can't have another four years of Barack Obama. We can't have another four years of Hillary Clinton.

(APPLAUSE) We just can't do it. I watched that debate last night with the three of them. I mean, one of them is -- what's he doing? He keeps mentioning my name. He was the mayor of Baltimore. That was his big claim to fame. Then he game governor because they thought he did a good job.

Turned out he did a horrible job. But he's in there constantly mentioning my name, Donald Trump, Donald Trump. I said, why does he have to talk about me? You know, look at the job this guy has done.

And then the other two. You know, you have a socialist, who is here actually. But you have a socialist and you have -- and I was going to say you have a socialist. It could be worse than that OK? It could be much worse than that.

And you have Hillary, and just -- if anybody watched that debate last night, what it means is tremendously high taxes, things are not going to happen with the military. We need to build our military so big, so strong, so powerful...

(APPLAUSE)

... that nobody, nobody is going to mess with us. We have to do it. You know, General Odierno left and he said the military is the least prepared that's it's been in generations. The least prepared. We need it more now than we ever needed it.

And I'm in the real estate business. I'm always getting listings. I get listings of different things. Bases, an Army base a Naval base, they're all -- everything is for sale.

And if it's military, it's for sale, and we can't have that. We're going to build it big, we're going to build it strong. And hopefully, we're never going to have to use it. You know, we're make it so strong nobody is going to want to mess -- that's really what we have to do.

And in the end, that's cheaper than the nonsense we're doing right now where nobody respects us. They're laughing at us. We don't know what we're doing. We can't beat ISIS, and I see, I see it on television. These generals, they get up and they talk on television. They're being interviewed. I don't want generals to be interviewed. One of the generals just recently, "Well, what do you think of the ISIS threat?" "Oh, they're very tough." "Well, can we beat them?" "Well, it's going to take a long " -- I don't want that kind of a general. I want a general where we knock the hell out of them fast.

(APPLAUSE)

And my generals, by the way, they're not going on television, OK? So the enemy can learn all about it. Oh, well, then we attack. How about President Obama recently, we're sending 50 people over there, our finest. What does he have to say that for? Why does he say it?

They have a target on their back. They are looking for those 50 people. They are looking for those 50 people right now more than any other people. Why does he have to say it? Why can't he just do it and not talk about it, right? Why can't he do it and not talk about it?

(APPLAUSE)

When the war in Iraq started, I was very opposed to it, I have to tell you, and I came out and I was very strong that I was opposed to it. Now I get -- you know, I used to take a little -- a little heat on that, but now I get a lot of credit for it. But in 2003, 2004, I said if you do that, you're going to destabilize the Middle East. It's going to be a disaster, one or the other, whoever we're going to knock them out, because we can knock them out pretty easily, is going to take over. The one that's not knocked out is going to take over.

So we knock out Iraq. Iran is taking over the Middle East. We have totally destabilized the Middle East and I said this in 2004. We have totally destabilized the Middle East. It's a disaster. And you look at this new Iran deal which took forever to get done. You look at how bad it is and how one-sided it is. You look at how one-sided this deal is.

And yesterday I heard we're getting our hostages back. Some people call them prisoners. Some people call them hostages. I don't care. So we're getting them back, and then I heard, well, wait a minute, we're paying a big price. They're getting seven back, we're getting actually four. You know, they say five, but the other one they can't find. He's in Iran.

I tell you what, that's a strange -- that's another thing we're going to be looking into. And we're getting -- we're getting four back, they're getting seven. They're getting 14 off of the Interpol watch list. These are real bad customers. They're getting all sorts of advantages, including free free market oil. They're getting unbelievable advantages.

They're going to be an immensely wealthy country and a wealthy terror country, and they're getting $150 billion. So when our sailors were captured last week, I said that's one of the saddest things that I have seen when those young people were on their hands and knees in a begging position with their hands up and thugs behind them with guns, and then we talk like it's OK.

It's not OK. It's lack of respect. We can't let that happen to this country. It's lack of respect and we're not going to let it happen to this country. We're going to be strong, we're going to be vigilant. We're going to have powerful borders and strong borders.

And look what just happened this morning. I don't know for any of you that have been seeing the news or reading the news, three people have just been kidnapped in Iraq because they see -- what the heck, we pay $150 billion for four people, three people just this morning, and this is going to take place all over. They should have come back as part of the deal three years ago when they started talking about the deal, not now.

(APPLAUSE)

Not now. And what should have happened -- what should have happened is our representatives -- first of all, we needed people that negotiate properly, not a guy like Kerry who doesn't have a clue. But...

And we will have those people. I know those people. We will have those people.

But when you look at what went on, our people, all you had to do was go in and say to the Persians, very good negotiators, great negotiators, legendary negotiators. They're known for it. They're sitting across the table. Fellows -- and in this case, it is all fellows. I hate to tell this to the woman, they're behind the fact, they're a little behind the fact.

They haven't figured out that women may be, in certain ways are much better than men, but I don't want to say that, because I will get myself in trouble with men. But they haven't figured this out yet, but that's OK.

You say, "Fellows, we want our prisoners back. Got to have them back. Doesn't help you, helps us, will make a better deal, the United States, the people, they want them back. They're talking about them. We want our prisoners back, got to give them back." They'll say "no, " and we'll say, "that's OK, don't worry about it, bye-bye." Get up, leave the room.

Now you double up the sanctions. Within 48 hours, they will call and they'll say, "We want our prisoners back, and here is your prisoners." And now you go in a second time. You don't mention this. You say, "Listen, the other thing -- I had to tell you, but I didn't want to tell you before we got our prisoners back, we're not going to give you any money, no money. We don't have it. We're a debtor nation. We owe $19 trillion. We're not going to give you any money."

And you want to be nice. You don't want to put it in their face. Just say, "Look, we're a poor nation. We've been mismanaged, we've been mis-run. We don't know what the hell we're doing, right?"

Is that true or what?

(APPLAUSE)

This isn't Jerry running our nation, that I can tell you. But we've been mismanaged, we don't know what we're doing, we have $19 trillion in debt. Going to be $21 trillion, because that ridiculous budget that was approved last week, which got approved so fast, that's going to add another $2 trillion. So we're going to be $21 trillion. So, we say "We can't give it to you, don't have it, sorry." And they'll probably be upset, but don't worry about it. A week will go by and they'll say, "Let's start negotiating." So, you could have saved -- you could you have gotten the prisoners out years ago for nothing, for nothing, without giving them these people -- who, by the way, deserve to have been in prison. These were serious.

And the Interpol people, forget it. These are bad dudes. These are bad people. So, they made like this incredible deal. But everybody makes good deals with the United States, because the world is smart and they use their smart people, and they use their most cunning street-wise people, and they know what they're doing. We have people that don't know what they're doing.

We want to be politically correct -- like Jerry Senior would say, politically correct. We want to be politically correct, and it's just not working.

And I think one of the reasons that people are showing up for me and the poll numbers are all showing up for me, it's not that I can't be -- I went to a great school, Ivy League school, all of that stuff, did well, smart guy. I even had an uncle, you know, if you believe in genes, some do, some don't. But I had an uncle who was a professor at MIT for decades, brilliant guy, Dr. John Trump.

We can all be politically correct. It takes too much time. It takes too much time.

(LAUGHTER)

And a lot of it is just wrong. I'll give you an example. You go into a department store, right? When was the last time you saw Merry Christmas? You don't see it anymore. They want to be politically correct.

If I'm president you're going to see Merry Christmas in department stores, believe me, believe me.

(APPLAUSE)

You're going to see it. You're going to see a lot of things. You're going to see beyond, you're going to see a lot of things. But that's one example. You go shopping today, you don't see it anymore. You hardly see anything. You see -- have a wall that's painted red. Oh, great, oh, that's wonderful.

We're going to be saying Merry Christmas again. And we're going to be saying Happy Holiday to the -- and I have friends that aren't Christian, they like to say, Merry Christmas. They love -- everybody loves it.

But we have taken it out of the vocabulary. It's not go to happen, OK?

Thank you. I love you, too. Thank you. That was very nice.

That was very nice. That was very warm, actually. Sometimes, you never know who is shouting. You never know if somebody...

(LAUGHTER)

You know, it's sort of interesting, when I go to the rallies, we had one the other day about 16,000, 17,000 people, the arena was packed and I'd go home and I'd say to my wife, darling, how did you like the speech? "Oh, it was good. How many people were there?" I'd say what do you mean? You didn't see it? "No."

And I say it all the time. They focus on my face. They never, ever, ever show the crowds. So she'll say how many -- it sounds like a roar because you know, when you have a lot of people like this, it sounds like a roar. But she'd say, "How many people were there, darling?" I'd say the place was packed, had to have 15,000, 18,000 people. In one case, we had 15,000 and we sent away 7,000 because they couldn't get into the arena.

I said you didn't see that? No. They focus on your face, they never show. But the thing I love about the protesters, and I thought the cameras were in like in a fixed position, they don't move, right? You know, what do I know about this stuff? So I figured they fixed, they can't move.

Except every time there was a protester screaming about something, those cameras could be like a pretzel. They turn around and I never saw anything like it.

(LAUGHTER)

And I love the protesters. We don't have many, honestly, but I love the protesters because if there's a protester up in that corner, the cameras would go up there and people would say -- they wouldn't talk about the protester, boy, that place was packed. I said that's right, because it's a movement. It's packed.

But you wouldn't see because the press, and I have to say this, is very, very dishonest. Now, not all of it, but most of it.

(APPLAUSE)

Very, very dishonest, and I've never seen -- actually, I've never seen anything -- I have seen financial press and they play games but, you know, the numbers are numbers. But with this press, this political press is brutal.

Now, 25 percent are good. Two percent are great, OK? that's not acceptable. Do we agree? Two percent is not acceptable, but the press is very dishonest. Like the camera trick. I call it the camera trick where they don't show.

So what's happening and what's happening in the country is you're not getting a real picture of the silent majority, which Jerry Senior had something to do -- and that's a phrase you should be really cognizant of because it is a silent majority, but I think I'm going to up it a little bit because it's no longer so silent. It's really a noisy majority. It's become a noisy majority.

People want to see greatness for our country. They want to see things happen. They want to see things happen and they're not seeing it.

(APPLAUSE)

These politicians are all talk. They're no action. They don't get it done. When I say we're going to build a wall, they all say wall, what are you talking? You can't build a wall. Of course you can build it. It's simple. China. China.

(LAUGHTER)

Think of it. China. Two-thousand years ago, China built the Great Wall of China. This is a serious wall, and they didn't have caterpillar tractors or, as we say komatsus, because so many are coming out of Japan. We have to stop that now, by the way. But they didn't have the equipment and they built a wall. Think of this, 13,000 miles long and this is a serious wall, OK? This wall is wide. This is like this and this is a serious wall.

So then we hear you can't build a wall. I say not only can I build it -- and the guys I'm talking to on the stage are saying you can't build a wall, can you? Because they don't know anything. They don't know how to fix the infrastructure of -- our bridges are crumbling, our roads are crumbling.

We spent $5 trillion in the Middle East and our country is going to hell. We got to bring it back. We got to knock the hell out of ISIS. By the way -- by the way...

By the way, so I didn't want to go into Iraq, but I didn't want to get out the way we got out because what happened, and I was always saying -- I have said this for years, I might have said this the last time I was here years ago, take the oil. Take the oil. Keep the oil. You know, in the old days, to the victor belonged the spoils. Us, we go in and fight, we lose trillions of dollars, we lose thousands and thousands of unbelievable people, We have wounded warriors who I love, all over the place. We get nothing.

Look at Iraq. What do we get? Nothing. And Iran, now takes over Iraq. I always say, Iran made the greatest deal with $150 billion. What a great deal, what a great deal. Two weeks ago, it came to me. That deal is nothing. They made the really greatest deal. They took over Iraq.

They've been fighting for Iraq forever under different names, but they've been fighting. And they were the same militarily. They'd fight and fight and fight. They'd go 10 feet left, 10 feet right, left, right, then they'd rest. Then Saddam Hussein would drop gas and people would say it's unfair, they'd stop. The whole thing.

This went on forever. And it would have gone on forever, but we decapitated one. Now, so what did we give Iran? We gave them $150 billion, the great deal and all that. And they're -- by the way, they're going to have nuclear -- they don't have to develop them anymore. They can buy them, that's so much money.

They'll do -- and they'll want them develop for. How about this? We see something wrong or we think there's something wrong, so we have to wait 24 days before we go in. But before the 24 days start, there's a whole procedure, so who knows how long it could be. Could be six months.

So something is going on. But the other one is even better, because in certain locations, it's called self-inspection. They have the right to self-inspect. So we call up and we say, listen, we hear you're building nuclear weapons over here. We want to go in.

No, no, you don't have the right. But we'll self-inspect. We'll go in and call up the next day. No, no, nothing is happening over there. Oh, thank you very much, I appreciate it, now we feel much better.

(LAUGHTER) These are the deals we make. Sergeant Bergdahl, anybody ever hear of Sergeant Bergdahl? We get Sergeant Bergdahl, a dirty, rotten traitor. Six people died going after him. Six people died going after Sergeant Bergdahl.

We get Bergdahl. They get five of the great killers that they've wanted for the last nine years. So we get Bergdahl, a traitor, and we knew he was a traitor before the deal because they had a general and a colonel talking to the people that he was with. So we knew he was a traitor. Who would make deals like this? Who does it?

UNIDENTIFIED: Obama.

(APPLAUSE)

DONALD TRUMP: Obama. Stand up. I like that. That was very good. That was good timing. Thank you. I love it. He's right. And I didn't want to say it because it's a little bit rough, but if he says it, that's OK.

(LAUGHTER)

Obama is a disaster. And you look -- take a look at our trade deals. These are deals that are the worst. We're going to lose $500 billion, trade deficits, with China. With Japan $100 billion, we're talking about a year. How do you have a country and then they say, well Trump doesn't believe in free trade.

No, I want free trade but I want it to be like at least we break even, right? We do something. But how do you lose the kind of numbers -- and remember they don't play by the rules. And I love China, by the way. I deal tremendously with China. I own a big chunk of the bank of America building in San Francisco through China.

I have apartments all over, condos through China. So much through China. I buy -- I do great business with China. They're fantastic. They're unbelievable. In fact, my daughter is here. Where is Ivanka? Where is Ivanka?

Stand up, Ivanka.

Anybody ever hear of Ivanka? (APPLAUSE)

Ivanka deals with China all the time, and we deal with Mexico and Mexico is great. I have great relationships with Mexico, with the Mexican people. I have thousands of people from Mexico and Hispanic people. These are great people, they're unbelievable. But their leaders are too smart for our leaders, they're too cunning for our leaders.

And you look at what they're doing not only on the border, but with trade. Nabisco, from Chicago -- no more Oreos, folks -- Nabisco is moving to -- they're moving their big plant from Chicago, they're moving it to Mexico. Ford is building a $2-and-a-half billion plant in Mexico. That's not going to happen -- I'm not going to -- I'm going to say folks, we've got to stop this. We're losing our jobs, we're losing our manufacturing jobs.

I go to schools -- and less so here because it's so good -- I go to very good colleges and I see students, and they're borrowed up to the neck. Everything -- the biggest problem is they graduate -- they study, they work, they do well, they get good marks, they're really wonderful, they're proud of themselves, then they can't get -- they come out, they can't get a job.

We've got to create jobs, we've got to bring back the jobs from China, we've got to bring back the jobs from Japan and all these countries that are ripping us off.

(APPLAUSE)

And we're going to do that, and we're going to do that. And just like I say -- OK, so I say who's going to build the wall, folks? You tell me. Who is going to build the wall?

AUDIENCE: Mexico!

DONALD TRUMP: Mexico. Everybody knows. I say that, again, they say, oh, you can't build a wall. So easy, you have no idea. And the reason it's easy and -- it is. For me, it's -- I just built a 92- story building. I mean, when you build buildings, building a wall, it's called like give me some pre-fab plank, bing! And I've got to make it, but I really...

(LAUGHTER)

... but I really -- I have to make it look beautiful. Why? Because some day, they'll name wall "Trump Wall, " and I've got to have it (INAUDIBLE)

(LAUGHTER)

(APPLAUSE)

And by the way, we want people to come in, but we want people to come into our country legally.

(APPLAUSE)

They'll go through a process, they'll go through a process. But one of the people I'm running against -- I won't use names because we don't want to insult anybody and this is really such nice religious people, I love it, such great Christians, I can't say bad. Am I allowed to say bad in this room? No, OK.

(LAUGHTER)

So here's the thing. I wouldn't say that. But the other day, for the first time I heard it, one of the folks said we're going to build a wall. I said what -- what's going on? I just heard him say he's going to -- nobody said that before, so they're all coming my way, you know? They're all coming my way. The only problem is they don't know where to begin; they wouldn't know where to begin.

And it'll be one of these walls, not one of those walls. See the height of that ceiling? If you got up there, if you got up there, you're on the other side, you're going to be really scared coming down. This is a serious wall.

(LAUGHTER)

And we can do it for the right price. And it doesn't matter because, again -- I don't know if you saw Saturday Night Live where they said the wall, but the wall -- did everybody see? A lot of people saw that. But, but just so you understand, the reason they're going to pay -- and the reason it's easy for a businessman to understand this, very easy -- Mexico is making a fortune on the United States.

Now, China, I love them, they're great. I'm not holding it against China. They're -- the largest bank in the world, Chinese bank -- is a Chinese bank. It's a tenant of mine. I don't hold that against them. Mexico, I don't hold it against Mexico. You see what's going on with the crime and all the -- I don't hold that against Mexico. If they can get away with it, if their politicians can do it, I hold it against our very stupid leadership in this country. That's what I hold it against. I don't hold it against these other countries.

(APPLAUSE)

I mean, if they can get away with it, let them do it. I want to get away with things. I could go into story after story after story, and I used to use the word incompetence, but it's not strong enough, you know? And then I used the other word -- you know the word I'm talking about, right? I use that word and then they say he's plain- spoken. My education is too good to be called plain-spoken, I'm not that plain-spoken. You know, I wrote "The Art of the Deal, " I wrote many bestsellers, like "The Art of the Deal " -- everybody read the -- who has read "The Art of the Deal " in this room? Everybody.

(LAUGHTER)

I always say -- I always say, a deep, deep second to the Bible. The Bible is the best. The Bible -- the Bible blows it away. There's nothing like the Bible, but "The Art of the Deal " was about -- in fact there are a few of them right over there. But "The Art of the Deal " was the best-selling business book, and Obama didn't read it and Kerry didn't read it.

But we can do things with our country that will be so good. But I have always use that word incompetent, they're incompetent. Now I don't care, I don't care. Again, I'm not being funded by these guys from Wall Street that have, you know, they own -- as Jerry, he called them puppets, it's true.

I'm doing, I'm self-financing my own campaign. I'm not taking funds. Isn't that nice?

(APPLAUSE)

So, we can do what's good for the country. In other words, we are going to do what's good for the country. And I tell people all the time, and use Ford as an example, you could use Nabisco. I could use a hundred companies. And by the way, you have a lot of corporate inversion going on, which is going to be beyond Mexico, you have companies leaving the United States because taxes are too high and lots of other things.

They're leaving, it's called corporate inversion. It's a disaster. They're leaving for lower taxes, or because they can't bring their $2.5 trillion back into the country. They just can't do it.

But take Ford, and I use this as an example. It could be anybody, it could be any company that goes into other countries, but take Ford going in -- $2.5 billion. So, they're taking a lot of stuff out of Michigan. They're taking a lot of -- they're closing other things and they're going to build this massive -- whoever heard of $2.5 billion for a one-story building?

Do you know how big that is? So, they're going to make cars, trucks, and parts. So I don't care about Ford. IN fact, he president of ford wrote me a very nice letter trying to explain, you know, that it was a good thing. It's not a good thing. But that's OK. When I'm president, I can say it even much stronger, right now I don't care, OK?

But he wrote me a nice letter, good company, run very well, good product. I love Ford, I love Chevrolet. I love all our products. We want to buy USA, right? But they wrote me, and I said, here's the story.

If, let's say, a stiff like Jeb Bush is president, OK?

(LAUGHTER)

Let's say he is president, OK? No, he's actually -- let's say Jeb Bush is president, OK? Low energy person, but that's OK. Let's say Jeb becomes president -- look, Jeb is president. Now, they will go to him. He has $128 million that he got from donors, special interest, everybody, lobbyists.

So Ford will hire one of the lobbyists. You know, they'll -- look, I know this game better than anybody. I have been playing this game for a long time, folks, on the other side. I changed sides. You know, I was total establishment. Now I'm like the worst thing that ever happened to the establishment, because I understand the game.

(APPLAUSE)

So now, they go to -- let's say Jeb, they say, "Mr. President, this is a very bad thing."

"Well, I agree it's bad. I agree it's bad. We have to do this, we can't allow this to happen." And then, he's going to get a call from his lobbyist or his special interest. "Mr. President, they gave you $5 million! You can't not make this deal." Well, did they? Another one is going to call. "Mr. President, they gave you $2 million, you got to take care of Ford."

All right, I'll do it. OK. That's the end. We lose the jobs, we lose all the different things.

With me, they're going to call. And by the way, Hillary, just as bad, even worse. Hillary, they'll call.

(APPLAUSE)

They're going to call Hillary and they're going to say, "Madam President " -- by the way, I want to see a woman president soon, but not her. She's a disaster. She's a disaster.

(APPLAUSE)

She's a disaster. And you just think of the corruption and the scandal. We don't want to go through it. You just don't want to go through it. We want to see winning. We want to see win, win, win. I always joke. I say we want to see win, win, win, constant winning. And you'll see if I'm president, and you'll say please, Mr. President. We're winning too much. We can't stand it anymore. Can we have a loss?

(LAUGHTER)

And I'll say no, we're going to keep winning, winning, winning because we're going to make America great again. And you'll say OK, Mr. President. OK.

(APPLAUSE)

But they'll call Hillary with Ford, right? They'll call Hillary and they'll say, madam -- and she'll do the same thing because her donors gave her a lot of money and they need the money for the next election. By the way, the only time the politicians really sort of work right is when they're sort of like retiring like the gentleman over there, the Congressman. Now, he's a young guy. He retired of his own volition because he knows what's going on in Washington, which I have great respect for.

But some of them retire, then they get a little bit tougher. But with Ford, you take a look. Now, they call them -- Ford moves in -- they call Trump. OK. Now it's President Trump, OK? President Trump. So...

(APPLAUSE)

So they call President Trump, and they say, Mr. President, I mean you have to do this. Ford has been great and wonderful. What are they building in Mexico for? What do we want a building in Mexico -- they're going to build -- remember this, cars, trucks and parts. They're going to sell them across the border. No tax.

So you say, we're all smart people. How does that help us? We close plants and we open new plants in Mexico and they sell -- and there's no tax. So they're going to say, no, no, no, we're going for it. I'll say here's the story. If you go forward, that's fine. But for every car, truck and whatever else you're building, you are going to pay a 35 percent tax every time it crosses the border.

We have to or we're not going to have a country left. Everyone is ripping us. Everyone is ripping us.

(APPLAUSE) Now, I don't want to do that because I'm a free trader. I want free trade, but we've got to be sort of like smart here, folks, because we've lost seven million, eight million and some people say 10 million jobs. We've lost 50,000 manufacturing plants. We're getting killed and the quality of our jobs is terrible. You saw that in the last report.

They have this phony number, 5.2 percent. Everybody that quits looking for a job is considered statistically a person that has a job. It's a phony number. You probably -- real numbers like 22, 23 percent. In fact, if you look at crowds like this and crowds wherever I go, if we were really at five percent, 5.2 percent, nobody would be there. Although they might be there because the military's so badly run with this president. I mean, you know, probably there for other reasons.

But basically, you wouldn't have the kind of crowds and the kind of poll numbers that we have. So I'll tell Ford the following: say look, you've got to move your plant back. They'll call me, I'll have a few people call me. Doesn't matter because they didn't give me any money. They don't own me. Jerry was right, they don't own me. Self- funding, they don't own me.

I'll say, look, Mr. President of Ford, I'm sorry, you've got to -- you know, got to build over here, otherwise we're charging you tax. He's going to say, no, Mr. President. That's terrible. I'll say do me a favor, think about it overnight, call me back. He'll call me back the next day. I guarantee you 100 percent he will say Mr. President, we have decided to build our plant in the United States, OK? That's what has to happen.

(APPLAUSE)

Has to happen. It has to happen. And again, free trade is good, but we have to be smart about it or we're not going to have a country left. So when this started and I call it a journey, on June 16th, the escalator -- has everyone seen the famous escalator coming down? I was coming down to reporters, it looked like the Academy Awards. I'd never seen so many cameras in my life. And I sort of -- you know, Jerry said something that's true. He said it's very hard for somebody to run for president -- very hard for somebody that's very successful -- I've heard this all my life -- to go into politics, especially if you're going to run for president, because you're really exposing so much.

I mean, you're doing deals, and deals and deals. And plus, you don't do this. Who would have know that I was going to do -- I like the debates. I love doing debating, but I never debated before. The politicians do all the time. They're all talk, no action. That's all they do is debate but they don't get anything do.

And then on top of it, most of them are -- they're not even good debators, which is sort of amazing. You'd think at least they could debate properly right. It's amazing. Some of the things that they say is really just incredible.

But we're coming down the escalator and I say to my wife, OK. We have to do it. I'm just seeing so many stupid things. I said, we have to do it. We've got to go and we've got to do it. And she said, if you want to do it, I'm with you 100 percent. She's been so supportive.

Thank you. And I got on the escalator and we're going down. And I'm waiving. And I'm saying wow and I went up and I started talking about illegal immigration. And boy, did I take it.

For two weeks, Rush Limbaugh said, the most income he's ever seen a human being tank. But I didn't give up because you can never give up. One of the things I do when I speak about success and a lot of people ask me to speak about success. Where, it's just great.

I love speaking about it because I can help people. One of the things I said is, you've got to love with you do, but you can never -- and this applies to so many young, incredible people in this room -- you can never, ever give up. You can never give up. If you give up, you're not going to make it.

I've seen people over the years. I went to Wharton and I know people that have been -- were phenomenal students, brilliant. But they didn't have that drive. They didn't have that stick-to-it-ness. And they didn't make it like other guys that were not good and not as smart. But they had tremendous drive. And those are the people that are running the country now. So you've really got to never, ever quite or give up.

(APPLAUSE)

So I said -- so important for the room. I figure I get out of politics for at least two sentences right? But it's so true. Just don't quit. And for you, always, always, go into a field that you love. You've got to love it. You've got to love it. If you don't love it, you're not going to be successful.

Even if people say, oh, you shouldn't have, you've got to love it. If you don't love what you do, you're never going to be successful.

UNIDENTIFIED: You make us proud to be American.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, that's beautiful. Wow. I make you proud to be an American. Stand up. And do I have -- did I ever meet you before? No?

(APPLAUSE)

That's very nice. Thank you Matt. Thank you. We mean that, we mean it. That's very nice.

(APPLAUSE)

So, I took a lot of incoming as Rush said, who is a great guy. Tremendous incoming and I stuck and I even doubled down. And then all of the sudden, you had tremendous stats coming out, which were terrible, but tremendous numbers.

And you saw the kind of crime and you saw the tape in San Francisco and you saw other, Jameal in Los Angeles. A woman, 65 year-old veteran, who was raped, sodomized and killed by an illegal immigrant. And you saw the kind of horror that was going on.

Not only in terms of the border, not only in terms of coming in, not only in terms of drugs that are pouring across -- drugs, which are going to ruin the fabric of our country, are pouring across the border. But also, in terms of the volume, the sheer volume.

And then people started saying, you know, Trump is right. And I will say this. If I didn't talk about illegal immigration in my opening remarks, I don't even think you'd be talking about it today. And it's one of the most important things that anybody is talking about.

(APPLAUSE)

One of the most important things. So, when it sorted out, I started talking about the different things. Common Core, very bad. You've got to educate your children locally, OK. Very bad.

(APPLAUSE)

Second Amendment, very good. We have got to have the right to protect ourselves. Very good.

(APPLAUSE)

Now, we have people -- you know, the whole gun situation is under siege, now they're talking about, we want to give less bullets, we want to take bullets away, we want to -- I mean, they are talking about -- you can't let it happen.

By the way, in Paris, which has probably the toughest gun laws in the world, and France, had bullets been going the other way, you wouldn't have had 130 people killed, and plenty more to follow who were so badly injured.

(APPLAUSE)

In California, recently two weeks ago, where you had the 14 people killed and others to follow, because of the tremendous injuries. But where you had the 14 by these radicalized people. Where the people that were killed gave them wedding parties. They held wedding parties; they knew them, they were friends.

They went in, they killed 14 people. If we had somebody, a couple of guys like him, or him -- or definitely him, with the white hat on -- with a gun strapped in here, and the bullets could go the other way, you wouldn't have had the same -- you would have had problems. You wouldn't have had it to the same extent at all.

We need the Second Amendment. Don't let anybody take it away.

(APPLAUSE)

If I get elected, it's totally protected. Totally protected.

We have to do something -- and these were the things I talked about. We have to do something about super-PACs, because super-PACs are now running the country, because they are running our politicians, and our politicians aren't doing what is right for all of us.

We have got to get rid of these super-PACs. We want to have a clear vision of who's doing, and what's being put up, and who's putting it up. Got to get rid of super-PACs. Really, really, really bad.

So, then with Paris -- pretty much the start of Paris, all of a sudden, Paris happened, and my poll numbers went way up and I didn't know what happened. I said, why? And then, CNN actually did a big poll and a big study. And they said, "Trump is number one by far on the military. By far on protection, by far on the border. By far on ISIS."

Because they see me, because of my very strong stance on illegal immigration. It's an off-shoot. I won't let the Syrians that we have no idea who they are, they want to come into our country, they may be ISIS. It might be the great Trojan Horse of all time.

Who knows? We cannot take a chance. I want to build a safe-zone some place in Syria, what's happening in Germany is a disaster. What's happening in Brussels, you look -- what's happening all over Europe. Europe is being absolutely swamped and destroyed.

What's going on with the crime and the problems. And it could be some sinister plot. You look at these migration, you look at the lines. And you look at the tremendous amounts of young, strong men in those lines. And you say, what's going on?

Now, Obama wants to take in thousands and thousands of people. We can't do it folks; we can't do it. We don't know anything about the people. We're going to do a free-zone and a safe-zone. We're going to do something where we have to get the Gulf states -- they have nothing but money.

We have got to get them to fund it. We have got to get them to put up the money.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to get them -- don't forget, without us, they wouldn't be there very long. We protect them.

And with the military -- by the way, we're protecting countries that are behemoths. We're protecting countries that are so rich, so powerful, so incredible -- South Korea. We protect South Korea. I have many friends -- I have deals, I have buildings in South Korea.

But we're protecting South Korea. We have 28,000 soldiers on the line, between the maniac and South Korea. We're protecting them. They pay us peanuts. We protect Germany. We protect Japan. We protect countries that nobody even knows about. We protect Saudi Arabia. Before the oil price down, Saudi Arabia was making $1 billion a day. We protect them. They pay us, like, practically nothing compared to the cost.

They've got to pay up. They've got to pay up. Everybody's got to pay up. We can't do this anymore. We've got to run it like a business, but with heart. We can have great heart.

We're going to create health care, we're going to get rid of Obamacare, we're going to terminate it.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to repeal it and we're going to replace it. And now you see the signs. The stock market is starting to go down big league and a lot of bad things. I've been saying this. We're in a bubble. We're ridding a big, fat, juicy bubble. We're giving out loans for nothing. We're giving out -- you know, you look at what's happening with -- with our money. You look at what's happening with the Federal Reserve.

So we're riding a bubble. It could be really ugly, but right now, you're starting to see at least the beginning signs of it because the stock market, which was the only indicator that things were good is starting to go down.

So what happened is with Paris, I really look a different turn. And now I'm back and really back to security and security for our country and great, great military. We're going to build that military -- great, great military. And people are loving it and people need it and they don't have confidence in the politicians and they don't have confidence essentially in the other candidates because when you're leading by the kind of numbers that I'm leading by, they don't have confidence in the other candidates because they understand politicians.

We've been dealing with politicians for the last -- so many years. We're so tired of dealing with these people. They're no good for what we have to do. So -- so we're going to do things that can be done. We're going to fix our military. We're going to take of our vets, who are the greatest people, most incredible people. They're treated horribly.

(APPLAUSE) I mean, our vets -- our vets are treated worse than illegal immigrants in many cases. You see what's going on? Our vets are not being treated properly. We're spending tremendous amounts of money. The corruption in the V.A. administration -- I mean, the Veterans Administration is beyond belief. We're going to fix the situation so our vets are taken care of the way they should be taken care of.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to do all of these things and we're going to create security. We're going to have great security. So in a nutshell, number one, it's an honor to be here again. It's an honor in terms of Martin Luther King to have broken the record. We're dedicating the record to the late, great Martin Luther King, OK? But it's an honor.

And very simply, and I didn't use to say this, two, three weeks ago I wouldn't say it, but I think I can say it now because I've seen so many people. We have such amazing people in this country, smart, sharp, energetic. They're amazing. I was saying make America great again. I actually think we can say now, and I really believe this, we're going to get things coming. We're going to get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries.

(APPLAUSE)

And I honestly think I can say, and I've said it for the last two weeks and I mean it 100 percent or I wouldn't say it, we're going to make America great again, greater than ever before. And we can do that. And we're going to win, and we're going to win a lot.

I want to thank you. I want to thank Jerry and Becky and everybody. We love you all. You're a special school, a special university and amazing people. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)
