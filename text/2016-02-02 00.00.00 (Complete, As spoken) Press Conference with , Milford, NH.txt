DONALD TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE)... I never said that. It's not a statement I would have made. No. I've had a great relationship with Iowa.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: I don't really think -- look, what happened is we had 17 candidates originally. I was expected to come in like anywhere maybe 10, 11, 12, 13. I ended up coming in second. Didn't devote tremendous time to it. Didn't devote tremendous money to it.

In fact, I guess in terms of money per vote, I'm about at the bottom, meaning the most efficient.

I came in second. I came into strong second. Third, I think, was quite a bit away -- I think 2,500 or something -- close to 3,000 votes away. There's a big difference between second and third.

I think we did really well. You know, as far as that's concerned.

I think the press -- some of the press said I did fantastically well. Some of the press doesn't want to give it credit.

I think we did very well. I didn't expect to do so well. I guess what did happen is one poll came out and said I'm 4 or 5 points ahead and that maybe build up a false expectation for some people.

But it had taken me back to June 16th. I was told "Don't even go to Iowa. Start right here in New Hampshire. Just don't waste your -- "

... I'm going to Iowa. I went. I bonded with the people, bonded with evangelicals. We did really fantastically and came very close to winning. I mean, we came very close to winning. We came in second place.

So I am very happy with what happened in Iowa. You know, you had 17 people and I was second. Now, I guess you have 11 people and I was second. And I think we did a very good job.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: No, I don't think I feel any pressure. I mean, we're going to just do what I have to do. And if it works out, that's great. And if it doesn't, that's okay too because you know I'm here to do one thing -- the theme -- make America great again. I'm going to do it.

And I think we did very well -- I think we did really well in just about everything we've done running for office. I think we have a very good result yesterday. It could have been a little bit better. It could have been one notch better.

But it's interesting all of these governors and senators that you have way down the list, they're at 1%, 2%, you know, in terms of what happened -- what just happened -- they're at 1%, they're at 2%, they're 3%. Nobody ever talks about them. And I'm at 24% or 25%, and they say, "Oh, couldn't you have done better?"

You know, I think the result was quite good especially for the amount of time I spent and for the amount of money I spent.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think I have -- I think it fits me better, probably suits me better. I've done very well in New Hampshire. I've been here a lot more. I have very good relationships with the people of New Hampshire.

But I've had very good relationships with pretty much everybody.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: I really don't. I really don't see that happening. I don't know what's going to happen. You don't -- nobody does. We'll see what -- you'll have many, many people that aren't doing very well. I am doing very well. But you have many, many people that are here, that are well-known politicians -- they're governors and they're senators -- but they're not doing very well. And they just came back from a, you know, very major defeat yesterday. And mine wasn't.

... You know, it's very interesting. If you look at the numbers from yesterday, I got the highest number in history outside the one number -- in the history of the primary.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: ... Also, I guess they had 185,000 people, which is 45,000 or 50,000 people more than they ever had.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: No, I mean, I think we'll get a lot of Sanders's voters. You know, they're very much into the trade world and I'm the best on trade. He mentions it but I don't think he's going to be capable of doing anything about it.

No, I think we're going to do really well here. I look forward to it.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: We have a lot of events scheduled, yes.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, we do. We have one commitment long-term for Arkansas actually where we're going to have about 10,000 people. But we're going to be back and forth very quickly. We're going to have a lot of events scheduled, yes.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I just think, you know, I'm just happy with the way we're doing. You know, we've bonded with the people whether it's there or here. I mean, there's just a big bonding process going on.

If you look at South Carolina, it's the same thing. I mean, we're doing really well there. But we've devoted much more time here and South Carolina --

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: It's not a question of learning. I mean, I just want to continue to do well... Our theme -- the theme is so important. It's just make America great again. That's what we're going to do. That's what we're going to do. Not really a question of learning.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, if you look at the second place, people didn't talk about my second place. They didn't talk about it as positively as they should have. And yet, with Marco who was more than 2,000 votes behind me -- that's a lot of votes by the way -- they said, "Oh, he's surging. He's surging."

So, I don't know why is the third place person doing well and the second place person, who by the way has never run -- Scott was mentioning before -- "One of the amazing things about you, you've never run for office before. It's incredible how you did."

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: My brand's doing great. Yeah.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: No, I think just work. We're going to work very hard and we have a lot of meetings, a lot of talks, a lot of speeches. We're going to be meeting with a lot of people and I think we're going to do very well.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, we'll be doing some of that but we also have some very big events planned like tonight, I think they have 4,000 or 5,000 people and other people were here yesterday and they had 200 people. Same venue, same everything. They had 200 people.

So we have -- there's a good bonding going on.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I enjoyed it.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: I have unlimited, I have unlimited -- you know, it's funny. When I look at the various people, they said so and so has $20 million. I have unlimited. That's not the thing.

The only -- you know, I'm a businessperson. I want to spend wisely. And I'm probably $40 million under budget because of the fact that frankly I haven't had to spend very much although I guess we just did a recent filing and I would be probably having spent now maybe $14 million, $15 million.

But I'm self-funding. And I must tell you, I don't know that enough people appreciate it. I'm self-funding anyway whether they appreciate it or not. So I won't be influenced by the lobbies and you know etcetera, etcetera.

But I don't know -- I was talking to Scott about this before -- I don't know it's really appreciated by the voters. I'm the only one on both sides that's self funding. I'm putting up my own money. And I don't know that the voters appreciate it. When they go into vote, I don't think they say "I'm going to vote for Trump because he's self-funding and he's not going to be influenced by lobbies and special interests etcetera."

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: I'm going to tell them and I tell them. But sometimes they like it but I don't think it's something they vote for, which is a shame because it's actually a very big thing. You understand that. It's a very big thing. It's a very big element if you could have somebody that can actually self-fund and not be influenced by bad decisions... or looking for themselves or looking for the company or country they represent. That's a real positive...

I just don't know whether or not the voters appreciate it.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: I've learned that they're great people. I really, I thought the people in Iowa were fantastic... You know, obviously I was second. I had the largest vote getting in the history of a Republican primary except for one and I brought many of those extra people in. And they also had as you know the largest turnout in the history of Republican primaries in terms of Iowa by far -- not even close. I think it was like 50,000 or 60,000 more than they've ever had before. So I just -- I learned that they are terrific people in Iowa.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, I look forward to it.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: ... No, I don't think so. I have a very good relationship with Marco. I like him... I don't see that necessarily.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: You're talking about Iowa? Well, that could have been with the debate. I think it could have been the debate. I think some people were disappointed that I didn't go in the debate.

If I had to do it again, I would have done the exact same thing. And the reason is -- you know why? Because I raised $6 million for the vets in one hour.

So if I took a second place instead of a first place and could give the vets $6 million, I'll do that all day long.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, we're going to be spending money. We're going to be spending money -- we're going to be spending a lot of money. We'll be spending money on ads and we'll be spending money on the ground game.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: I can't help it, honey, whether I'm celebrity. I mean, this is me.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: Look, I think most people say I did a great job in Iowa. I came in second. I spent far less than anybody else. And had I known that I was going to be liked as much as I am in Iowa and people did like me -- you will understand that -- I would have maybe spent a little bit more and I would have been there a little bit more and maybe I would have won it. But, you know, I'm very happy with it. I have 7 delegates right at the top.

You look at other people in all fairness -- senators, governors -- they're, you know, they're way down.

When I have 25% or 26% and they have 1% but you people don't mention that.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: But the one thing is you people don't mention that. You don't mention all the other names.

Now, you mention the person, Marco, good guy. But he came in third. And they make it sound like he had a victory and I didn't. But I came in second.

... I started off on 17th. I was 17th. When I first started, I had nothing. And then I inched my way up -- went pretty rapidly actually. And now I'm leading everything and I did okay in Iowa. Pretty good in Iowa.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think we're going to have great success here. I think it's a much different kind of a process. This isn't a caucusing process. This is a much different -- this is a normal voting process. The Iowa is a much different kind of a thing.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, he (referring to Ted Cruz) insulted me. I mean, he started with the insults, as you know. And he insulted Ben Carson by doing what he did to Ben Carson. That was a disgrace. And he insulted the people of Iowa by doing a voter violation form that nobody's ever seen before which was disgraceful. No, no, he's a man of insult.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: No, I'm going. I have thousands of people going. No, but we don't have that invite. I like Mike Huckabee but no, I don't think he's even going to be there.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: I did. I did. No, I like him. Well, he's left the race so I feel pretty good about that. He's a good man.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, we're adding some and we're adding them pretty rapidly.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: ... People in your world are saying they possibly could. So I don't really see one or two. I see there could be a number.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: I'd love to finish first. You know, again it would still not be horrible because you're competing against a lot of very talented people that have been politicians all their lives. I have been a politician for 6 months.

No, but I'd love to finish first.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: Wouldn't horrible but you know it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. I could think of worse things. But I'd like to finish first. I think we will finish first. I'd like to finish first.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: ... Just so you understand. I am totally self-funding my campaign other than small donations because people send in small donations for $10, $15, $20...

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, that's merchandise sales. That's a lot of merchandise sales.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: It's a small amount of money compared to what I put in.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: It's very hard when somebody sends you a check for $17.50 and $9 and $200, very hard to send that back.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: I am. And I always make the reference. I always make a reference to that and I do it every time.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, he's (referring to Scott Brown) somebody that I respect, always liked. And he's very, very respected throughout the country but he's very respected here. And everybody wanted his endorsement and I'm very honored that he's giving it to me and he's going to give it to me on the stage.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: That happens with endorsements. No, that happens with endorsement. It's pretty common with endorsements.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: ... A poll came out a few days before that said I was about 5 points so maybe there was a tinge.

And again, it may have been the debate, which would have set records if I did it. So I would have liked that. But the fact is it could have been the debate. Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. But I would have done it exactly the same way because I raised, Scott, we raised in one hour, I raised $6 million for the vets. And I would never, ever give that up to go between first and second in Iowa. Wouldn't be worth it.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: I think her email situation is very serious. I have a feeling she's being protected by the Democrats because it just looks to me to be more serious than anybody that I've seen including Gen. Petraeus.

If you watch and study and read about various lawyers -- you know, that's what they do -- they really feel she's in grave danger and what she's done is against the law not just against rules. It's against the law. I just don't know what's going to happen because I don't know whether or not the Democrats are going to protect her.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: I never saw a race where they're flipping coins. I mean, they're flipping coins. What kind of a race is that? It's ridiculous. I thought it was terrible. I mean, you call it a tie. But to flip coins, they say "Okay, you're going to get this district. We're going to flip a coin."

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. I can't tell you yet. I think he's (referring to Ted Cruz) certainly was dirty what he did to Ben Carson was terrible. He did the voter violation form. I thought that was terrible. Actually, I thought it was terrible. And when they said that Ben Carson was out of the race and come vote for him, I thought that was terrible.

Okay?

Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you.
