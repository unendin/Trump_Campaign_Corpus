CHUCK TODD: Some of the criticism on you from conservatives is you're not a real conservative. When you hear that -- You know, someone will argue on social policies that you're not a real conservative. Is it just different brands of conservatism that's out there and you just have a different brand? Or do you think they have a point?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think they have a point from years ago. But they also have that same point with Ronald Reagan, who was a Democrat absolutely with a liberal bent. And Ronald Reagan became, you know, not only a Republican but a pretty conservative Repub -- not the most. But a pretty conservative Republican. And he's somebody that I actually knew and liked. And he liked me. And I worked with him and helped him. But I think that when you get right down to it, people do evolve on different issues. And, you know, I'm pro-life. And I was begrudgingly the other way. But I have to say when those questions were asked, and that was many, many years ago, I wasn't a politician.

CHUCK TODD: Should some form of abortion always be legal?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, to me, I have exceptions. Rape, incest, if the mother is going to die. And Ronald Reagan had those same exceptions. And many Republicans have those same exceptions. But I say rape, incest --

CHUCK TODD: You said life of the mother. What about health of the mother?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I said actually if the mother's close to death. And I'm talking about death. You know, because then you sort of say, like, "Well, maybe she's not feeling so well -- "

CHUCK TODD: Well, that's the line here. What is the constitutional right --

DONALD TRUMP: Well --

CHUCK TODD: -- between the mother and the unborn child? Whose --

DONALD TRUMP: My --

CHUCK TODD: -- constitutional rights matter more?

DONALD TRUMP: Right. My statement on that happens to be, you know, if the mother will die. And you're going to know that. And the problem with the life: If you say life, what does life mean? You have a cold and you're going to end up having an abortion. So I have the three exceptions and pretty much the standard three exceptions that many Republicans have.

CHUCK TODD: You were pretty -- you were somewhat defending Planned Parenthood earlier this week. It struck me that there was a time Planned Parenthood was not seen as a very political organization. Were you ever a donor to Planned Parent --

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. I mean, I don't know --

CHUCK TODD: It's possible?

DONALD TRUMP: But it's possible. I give to so many, Chuck. I give to so many organizations over the years. Hundreds of millions of dollars. And so I don't know. I don't think so. But it's possible somewhere --

CHUCK TODD: It wouldn't have surprised you if you had?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, it could be. Look, Planned Parenthood has to stop with the abortions. A lot of people consider it an abortion clinic. I think those tapes that I saw over the last -- the five tapes or the six tapes, I think they were outrageous. I think they were terrible, disgusting by any standpoint. And they have to stop.

CHUCK TODD: Does it bother you that they --

DONALD TRUMP: At the same time --

CHUCK TODD: -- were edited? Do you think they --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't know about them being edited. All I did, I mean, whatever I saw was terrible --

CHUCK TODD: It's what you saw.

DONALD TRUMP: I mean, it was terrible. And in particular, I didn't like the attitude of the people. They talked about it almost like we're making widgets or gadgets. And it was inappropriate.

CHUCK TODD: So you would not shut down the -- you don't think there should be a government showdown, shutdown over Planned Parenthood funding --

DONALD TRUMP: I wouldn't fund it if they have the abortion going on. And it's been a big factor. Now, you hear all different numbers. They say it's 3%. Other people say it's 85%. That's a big difference. So I'd certainly look into it. We have to keep --

CHUCK TODD: But would you shut down the government over this dispute?

DONALD TRUMP: I would not fund if they're doing abortions.

CHUCK TODD: But as you know, there could be a stalemate in Congress. Is it worth shutting down the government over?

DONALD TRUMP: It's something I'd have to think about to be honest with you. I don't want to give a hard and fast answer to that. It bothers me greatly that they're doing the abortions. At the same time, women's health issues are, you know, very important to me.

CHUCK TODD: Let's go foreign affairs. You want to knock the hell out of ISIS. How?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I want to take away their wealth. And, as you know, for years I've been saying, "Don't go into Iraq." They went into Iraq. They destabilized the Middle East. It was a big mistake. Okay, now we're there. And you have ISIS. And I said this was going to happen. I said, "Iran will take over Iraq, " which is happening as sure as you're sitting there. And ISIS is taking over a lot of the oil and certain areas of Iraq. And I said you take away their wealth, that you go and knock the hell out of the oil, take back the oil. We take over the oil, which we should have done in the first place. And --

CHUCK TODD: It's going to take ground troops.

DONALD TRUMP: If you re --

CHUCK TODD: What you're talking is --

DONALD TRUMP: TODD: -- ground troops.

That's okay.

CHUCK TODD: Maybe 25,000 --

DONALD TRUMP: We can circle it. We can --

CHUCK TODD: How ma --

DONALD TRUMP: -- circle it. We're going to have so much money. And what I would do with the money that we make, which would be tremendous, I would take care of the soldiers that were killed, the families of the soldiers that were killed, the soldiers, the wounded warriors that are -- I love them. And they're walking all over the streets of New York, all over the streets of every city without arms, without legs, and worse than that. And I would take care of them. They paid a big price --

CHUCK TODD: So America should take over these oil fields. Shouldn't be given to the Iraqis?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, we can give them something. But we should definitely take back money for our soldiers. We've had soldiers that were decimated, so badly hurt, the wounded warriors, and killed of course. But we've had soldiers that were so badly hurt and killed. I want their families to get something. Because we got nothing out of that war. We spent $2 trillion, Chuck. We had thousands of people killed. Wounded warriors all over the place. They got nothing. And they can't even say we had a victory.

CHUCK TODD: Who do you talk to for military advice right now?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I watch the shows. I mean, I really see a lot of great -- you know, when you watch your show and all of the other shows and you have the generals and --

CHUCK TODD: So you do the --

DONALD TRUMP: And you have certain people that you like --

CHUCK TODD: But is there a go-to for you? You know --

DONALD TRUMP: Probably there are --

CHUCK TODD: -- every presidential --

DONALD TRUMP: -- two or three --

CHUCK TODD: -- candidate has a go-to --

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, probably there are two or three. I mean, I like Bolton. I think he's, you know, a tough cookie, knows what he's talking about. Jacobs is a good guy --

CHUCK TODD: Do you mean Ambassador John Bolton --

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. I think he's terrific --

CHUCK TODD: You mean Colonel Jack Jacobs?

DONALD TRUMP: Colonel Jack Jacobs is a good guy. And I see him on occasion.

CHUCK TODD: You wrote this in 2011 about Saudi Arabia. "It's the world's biggest funder of terrorism. Saudi Arabia funnels our petro dollars, our very own money, to fund the terrorists that seek to destroy our people while the Saudis rely on us to protect them." What are U.S.-Saudi relations going to look like under a Trump administration?

DONALD TRUMP: We --

CHUCK TODD: -- that paid back some stuff --

DONALD TRUMP: We got nothing. And, you know, I met the Kuwaitis right after --

CHUCK TODD: Secretary Baker did collect a lot of money --

(OVERTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: A lot. But nothing compared to what we spent. Nothing compared to what we spent. And I'll never forget shortly after the war the Kuwaiti fund came to see me. And they wanted to do a deal. And I said, "We have a great deal in the United States." They go, "No, no, no. Not United States. Not United States. We don't want to invest in United States." We gave them back their country.

CHUCK TODD: But to go back to Saudi Arabia, if they're a funder of terrorists, why should we have diplomatic relations with them at all?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, look, I'm not a big fan --

CHUCK TODD: Should we be --

DONALD TRUMP: I'm just --

CHUCK TODD: -- holding them more accountable?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, you know --

CHUCK TODD: They treat women poorly.

DONALD TRUMP: The primary reason we are with Saudi Arabia is because we need the oil. Now, we don't need the oil so much. And if we let our people really go, we wouldn't need the oil at all. And we could let everybody else fight it out. Look, Saudi Arabia is going to be in big trouble pretty soon. And they're going to need help.

Because if you look at Yemen and you look at that border, you don't have to be an expert to know that is one long border. And they're not going in for Yemen. They're going in for the oil. They're going in for Saudi Arabia. So Saudi Arabia is going to need help.

Like it or don't like it, people have backed Saudi Arabia. What I really mind though is we back it at tremendous expense. We get nothing for it. And they're making a billion dollars a day.

CHUCK TODD: We do have a running theme here. You believe the U.S. should -- you're okay with the U.S. being the world's police --

DONALD TRUMP: We should at least --

(OVERTALK)

-- be reimbursed --

CHUCK TODD: -- if we get paid --

DONALD TRUMP: -- by these extremely wealthy countries, yes --

CHUCK TODD: So essentially you want --

DONALD TRUMP: Chuck, we --

(OVERTALK)

CHUCK TODD: It turns our --

DONALD TRUMP: We have --

CHUCK TODD: -- military into a mercenary force.

DONALD TRUMP: No, not at all. Look, we are a debtor nation. We owe, I mean, now it's 1.9 trillion, okay? I've been saying 1.8. Now, it's 1 point -- it's really kicked in. It's soon going to be 2.4 trillion dollars, okay? That's like a point, whether you believe in the great economists or not, that seems to be a point of no return. That's where we're Greece on steroids, okay?

We're going to be there very soon. Why are we doing all of this? These are wealthy countries. They will give us, if we have the right messenger, they will give us. It's like this horrible deal with Iran. This deal, if you had the right, you'd have the prisoners back years ago.

CHUCK TODD: Iran would still get money. I understand --

DONALD TRUMP: Can you believe that deal?

CHUCK TODD: But let me ask you this.

DONALD TRUMP: No, no. Why is Iran --

CHUCK TODD: I understand there's a lot of people --

DONALD TRUMP: -- getting the money?

CHUCK TODD: I understand a lot of people are critical of the deal. But could you, what deal can you come up with that wouldn't give Iran money?

DONALD TRUMP: Okay, I would --

CHUCK TODD: That wouldn't give --

(OVERTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: I would have told them up front, "By the way -- "

CHUCK TODD: No sanctions relief?

DONALD TRUMP: "We will never give you back your money. We will never -- "

CHUCK TODD: Period --

DONALD TRUMP: -- "give you back your $150 billion. You're never getting that money back." That's number one. Number two, "Before we start negotiations, you have to give us our three prisoners." Now, it's four, okay? You know, when it started, it was three. Now, it's four. "You have to give us back. Without question, you have to give them back.

"And you know what? You don't want them. But we do. It's psychologically good. And it'll help us make a better deal together. That's good for you." Okay? But I would have told them up front, "You will never get your $150 billion back." They are going to be such a wealthy, such a powerful nation.

They are going to have nuclear weapons. They are going to take over parts of the world that you wouldn't believe. And I think it's going to lead to nuclear holocaust. And I will say this. The people that negotiated that deal, namely Kerry and his friends, are incompetent.

CHUCK TODD: What do you do on day one though?

DONALD TRUMP: Okay, I've heard a lot of people say, "We're going to rip up the deal." It's very tough to do when you say, "Rip up a deal." Because I'm a deal person. And --

CHUCK TODD: You get that --

DONALD TRUMP: -- when I --

CHUCK TODD: Even if you've made --

DONALD TRUMP: When I make deals --

CHUCK TODD: You've --

DONALD TRUMP: Let me tell you. But I will police that deal. You know, I've taken over some bad contracts. I buy contracts where people screwed up and they have bad contracts.

CHUCK TODD: But you have to abide by it.

DONALD TRUMP: But I'm really good at looking at a contract and finding things within a contract that even if they're bad. I would police that contract so tough that they don't have a chance. As bad as the contract is, I will be so tough on that contract.

CHUCK TODD: So the deal lives in a Trump administration --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, the deal --

CHUCK TODD: You're just going to be --

DONALD TRUMP: It's very hard to say, "We're ripping up." And the problem is by the time I got in there, they will have already received the $150 billion. Do you know if the deal gets rejected they still get the money? Which is something I found out a week ago. I couldn't believe it. If the deal gets rejected, they still get all of this money. Iran is going to be unbelievably powerful and unbelievably rich. And Israel's in big trouble. Israel is in big trouble. Obama has really let Israel down.

CHUCK TODD: So you believe the Saudis are going to get a nuclear weapon? You believe Egypt's going to after nuclear weapons --

DONALD TRUMP: I think other people will arm with nuclear weapons, yes, based on this deal. Because if you look at it, Iran will end up being nuclear. Even if it's not within the next fairly short period of time. And the whole thing about 24 days. First of all, the 24 days doesn't start immediately. There's a whole big deal before the clock starts ticking, right? So the 24 days could be much longer than that. In 24 days plus numerous weeks, you can do anything.

CHUCK TODD: If you get evidence they're working on a nuclear weapon, you order air strikes immediately?

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, I don't want to really say. I would be so tough you wouldn't believe. But I don't want to really say. You know, if I win -- and now I'm leading in every single poll. Even you will agree to that, right? Every single local --

CHUCK TODD: Yes, sir --

DONALD TRUMP: -- national, Iowa, New Hampshire, everything. If I win, I don't want to really be talking too much about -- Obama talks too much about what he's going to do. "We're going to raid here. We're going to do this." General MacArthur, General Patton, they didn't talk. They got the job done.

The executive order gets rescinded. One good thing about --

CHUCK TODD: You'll rescind that one, too?

DONALD TRUMP: One good thing about --

CHUCK TODD: You'll rescind the DREAM Act executive order --

DONALD TRUMP: You're going to have to.

CHUCK TODD: DACA?

DONALD TRUMP: We have to make a whole new set of standards. And when people come in, they have to come in legally --

CHUCK TODD: So you're going to split up families?

DONALD TRUMP: Chuck.

CHUCK TODD: You're going to deport children --

DONALD TRUMP: Chuck. No, no. We're going to keep the families together. We have to keep the families together.

CHUCK TODD: But you're going to keep them together out --

DONALD TRUMP: But they have to go. But they have to go.

CHUCK TODD: What if they have no place to go?

DONALD TRUMP: We will work with them. They have to go. Chuck, we either have a country or we don't have a country.

CHUCK TODD: The cost of --

DONALD TRUMP: Either, we have a country --

CHUCK TODD: -- doing this --

DONALD TRUMP: -- or not.

CHUCK TODD: How do you do it?

DONALD TRUMP: The cost of doing it? Look at the cost of what we have right now.

CHUCK TODD: But the cost of doing it.

DONALD TRUMP: Let me ask you this. Do you think there's --

CHUCK TODD: I understand that. But how do you it?

DONALD TRUMP: Do you think there's tremendous cost for the illegals that are in here right now?

CHUCK TODD: Of course there's cost to it.

DONALD TRUMP: Okay, tremendous. Do you think there's tremendous crime being committed by illegals?

CHUCK TODD: I know there's definitely evidence that it's happened.

DONALD TRUMP: Tremendous --

(OVERTALK)

CHUCK TODD: -- heinous crimes --

DONALD TRUMP: Far greater than what --

(OVERTALK)

CHUCK TODD: There's been some heinous ones.

DONALD TRUMP: And you see it all over. Just last night. All over. We will do it. And we will expedite it so people can come back in.

CHUCK TODD: It's still not clear to me here --

DONALD TRUMP: Chuck, it'll work out so well. You will be so happy. In four years, you're going to be interviewing me and you're going to say, "What a great job you've done, President Trump."

CHUCK TODD: Coming up, my lighting round with Donald Trump, including whether he believes President Obama is a U.S. citizen. And then there's this little nugget: I asked him why he felt it was necessary to constantly remind people that he attended the Wharton School of Finance. Here was his response.

DONALD TRUMP: Look, if I were a liberal Democrat, people would say I'm the super genius of all time. The super genius of all time. If you're a conservative Republican, you got to fight for your life. It's really an amazing thing.

CHUCK TODD: Welcome back. As everyone knows, Donald Trump has a lot of opinions about a lot of things. I did sort of a lightning round on issues with him, starting with his role in the birther movement, questioning President Obama's citizenship 4 years ago.

Let me go through some grab bags. What launched our relationship, shall we say, was back four years ago. Do you believe President Obama is a citizen who was born in the United States?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't like talking about it anymore. Because honestly I have my own feelings. I think he should have taken the $5 million. I don't know why he spent $4 million in legal fees to keep his records, you know, away. Nobody's seen his records. I don't know. Maybe --

CHUCK TODD: We're talking about the birth certificate.

DONALD TRUMP: Maybe the hackers. Maybe the hackers have his records. No, I mean, his college records. I mean, he spent $4 million in legal fees to make sure that nobody ever saw --

CHUCK TODD: Well, if you want him to release his --

DONALD TRUMP: So I'll tell you what --

CHUCK TODD: -- would you release all of yours --

DONALD TRUMP: But here's what I'll do.

CHUCK TODD: Would you release all your --

DONALD TRUMP: Here's what I'll do --

CHUCK TODD: -- college transcripts --

DONALD TRUMP: I'm proud of my records. But he has to do it. If he does it, I'll do it.

CHUCK TODD: President Obama tried to put a ban on lobbyists ever working in the administration. Will you do something like that?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's a pretty good idea. Because, you know, these guys get out and they almost immediately go to work for a company. And they have power that they shouldn't have. Look, when Jeb Bush raises $114 million, I know those people that gave him the money. I used to be one of them.

I mean, I gave to everybody, okay? I know those people. He's like a puppet for those people. He's a puppet. Those people, they'll take negative ads on me and on other people because they want him in there because they're going to control Jeb Bush. And not only Jeb. They're going to control Hillary. She raised 16 million plus. They're going to control whoever's in. The lobbyists, and the special interests, and the donors have 100 --

CHUCK TODD: So no lobbyists will work --

DONALD TRUMP: -- percent --

CHUCK TODD: -- in the Trump administration?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't --

CHUCK TODD: You'll have a ban?

DONALD TRUMP: I would certainly have a ban. Yeah, you can't put a lifetime ban. But you can certainly make it three, four years.

CHUCK TODD: What is a fair living wage? What's fair?

DONALD TRUMP: I want to keep the minimum wage pretty much where it is right now.

CHUCK TODD: You wouldn't raise it?

DONALD TRUMP: Because of the fact that we have a country that is now competing more than ever before because of airplanes, and transportation, and --

CHUCK TODD: So you think we got to keep --

DONALD TRUMP: -- the internet --

CHUCK TODD: We got to keep the minimum wage lower --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, we're not going to be able to compete with the rest of the world. I want to compete with the rest of the world. What I do want to do is bring in jobs so much so that people don't have to live on minimum wage. But we are going to have to compete with the rest of the world.

CHUCK TODD: All right. Toss you a quick Facebook question. Michael Martinez asks, "Residents of the District of Columbia currently pay federal taxes but have only a non-voting delegate in the House of Representatives, no representation in the Senate. Should that policy continue as is? Should D.C. become a state? Should it not have to pay taxes? Should it be treated like Puerto Rico -- "

DONALD TRUMP: Well, bas --

CHUCK TODD: "How should D.C. residents be treated -- "

DONALD TRUMP: I have a conflict of interest because I'm building the greatest -- you know, I'm building at the old post office I think what will be maybe one of the great hotels in the world --

CHUCK TODD: So I've heard.

DONALD TRUMP: It'll open. And, by the way, unlike our government, we're under budget and ahead of schedule. Isn't that a nice thing to hear? You don't hear that. Just like the wall will be under budget and ahead of schedule. And nobody's getting through that wall. Believe me.

CHUCK TODD: All right.

DONALD TRUMP: But --

CHUCK TODD: So the district.

DONALD TRUMP: So I have a little bit of a conflict.

CHUCK TODD: State or not?

DONALD TRUMP: I would like to do whatever is good for the District of Columbia because I love the people. You know, it's funny. I've really gotten to know the people, the representatives, and the mayor, and everybody. They're really special people. They're great. And they have a great feeling. So I would say whatever's best for them I'm for. I have a total conflict of interest.

CHUCK TODD: Your slogan, we're going to hear it a lot today at the fair. "We're going to make America great again." When was the --

DONALD TRUMP: Great slogan.

CHUCK TODD: When was the last time America was great?

DONALD TRUMP: I would say during the administration of Ronald Reagan you felt proud to be an American. You felt really proud. I don't think since then to any great extent people were proud.

CHUCK TODD: Then let me ask you this. Not trying play a little "gotcha " here. But in 1987 you took out a full-page ad. This is during the Reagan administration. And you said this. "To the American people. For decades, Japan and other nations have been taking advantage of the United States." On message, by the way. It's consistent. "The world is laughing at America's politicians as we protect ships we don't own carrying oil we don't need destined for allies who won't help." Message-wise, very consistent.

DONALD TRUMP: You know, I've been --

From day one including during the Reagan --

CHUCK TODD: I was just going to say --

DONALD TRUMP: Because look, NAFTA --

CHUCK TODD: Let's not let --

DONALD TRUMP: NAFTA --

CHUCK TODD: -- our great country be laughed at anymore. If that's the last time America was great again, you didn't think America was --

DONALD TRUMP: No, no --

CHUCK TODD: -- great then.

DONALD TRUMP: I thought America was excellent. I think NAFTA was a huge mistake. I thought it was a terrible mistake. And, you know, but I just think that he set a tone that was an excellent tone for the country. I disagree --

CHUCK TODD: Looking back, you seem to --

DONALD TRUMP: -- with some of his --

CHUCK TODD: -- like it.

DONALD TRUMP: No, I just --

CHUCK TODD: But at the time --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, looking back --

CHUCK TODD: This was a fire --

DONALD TRUMP: -- I like him more.

CHUCK TODD: This was a fiery guy.

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, he's --

CHUCK TODD: Donald J. Trump of 1987 was not --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, it's the same guy. If you think --

CHUCK TODD: Your consistence on --

DONALD TRUMP: I have been consistent over the years --

CHUCK TODD: I'll give you consistency. If you could win as an independent, would you be more comfortable running as an independent than as a Republican --

DONALD TRUMP: No, I want to run --

CHUCK TODD: I get why you don't want to run --

-- as an independent. Because it's not --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, it's more difficult --

CHUCK TODD: You probably couldn't win.

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, it's more --

CHUCK TODD: It's hard --

DONALD TRUMP: -- difficult. But it's not that. Look, somebody was asking me that question the other day times 50.

CHUCK TODD: I understand --

DONALD TRUMP: All right? I mean, I'm hearing it all the time.

CHUCK TODD: I know.

DONALD TRUMP: I'm running as a Republican. I'm leading by double digits for the most part --

CHUCK TODD: So just stay, "I'm going to stay as a Republican." Why is that so hard?

DONALD TRUMP: Because I'm not prepared to close that door yet. But I wouldn't be surprised if someday in the not too distant future it happens. They are treating me very well. I just want to be treated fairly. And, you know, I'm a person that believes in leverage.

CHUCK TODD: Alright. I sort of was amused about, this is a little excerpt from your Playboy interview in 1990. The questioner asks, "What is all of this?" -- meaning talking about your yacht, the bronze tower, the casino, what does it mean to you -- and you replied, "props for the show." And they said, "what show is that?" And you replied, "The show is Trump and its sold out performances everywhere."

DONALD TRUMP: And it has been for a long time.

CHUCK TODD: Are we all a part of a show? I mean --

DONALD TRUMP: No...

CHUCK TODD: -- there is, you know that some of the criticism that we feel like we're all part of a reality show?

DONALD TRUMP: No this is not a reality show. This is the real deal.

CHUCK TODD: But --

DONALD TRUMP: Our country has to be --

CHUCK TODD: You did smile when I read the show stuff.

DONALD TRUMP: I think it's fine --

CHUCK TODD: Because it resonated with you.

DONALD TRUMP: Look, my life has been an interesting life. I've had a lot of fun. I'm leading in the polls. I go on your show, you will get the highest ratings you've had in years. I mean it's one of those things assuming that people know I'm on.

I mean, whatever it is. Look at FOX, look what happened to FOX. I mean it's a whole crazy thing going on and all I care about -- and this is 100 percent truthful -- I love this country and I want to make it great again. And its not gonna be great if we keep going the way we're going, we're going to be third world, we probably already are. You look at our airports, our roads, our bridges, schools, our school system, we're 25. We spend more on individual students than anybody else. We're 25 in the world. We have to fix our country. We have to make our country great again.
