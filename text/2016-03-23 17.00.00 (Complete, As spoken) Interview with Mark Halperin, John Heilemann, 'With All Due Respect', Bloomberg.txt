MARK HALPERIN: Last night in Palm Beach, we sat down with Donald Trump at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach to talk to him in the aftermath of the terrorist attack in Brussels.

Amongst other matters, we asked him to clarify something he told "The Washington Post " editorial board earlier this week about whether he would ever consider using tactical nuclear weapons against the Islamic State.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP: I think I'd probably be very, very late compared to my opponents that are running. I -- you know, people don't realize, you know, I know a lot of people like to say he actually was sort of for the Iraq War.

I was against the Iraq War.

MARK HALPERIN: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: When I did the one interview many months before it started, it was like, I don't know. You know, this was the first time. And in all fairness, I've been a great businessman over the years. I was asked as a businessman. It didn't sound so good to me.

MARK HALPERIN: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: But by the time that started -- and there's plenty of proof on it, I mean there's plenty of articles from that time, or at least very early on, I was very much against the Iraq War.

Hillary Clinton wanted to do it. Hillary Clinton would be such a bad president. She doesn't have the strength and she doesn't have the stamina to be president, or to be a good president.

People wanted to go into Iraq. I didn't. You know, I'm supposed to be the one they're all saying oh, oh, he'd use -- I would probably be the last to use it.

MARK HALPERIN: I'm not...

DONALD TRUMP: But I have to say this, there are...

MARK HALPERIN: You'd probably be the last to use nuclear weapons...

DONALD TRUMP: Nuclear...

MARK HALPERIN: -- against ISIS?

DONALD TRUMP: -- nuclear.

MARK HALPERIN: But you're -- so you would -- you would rule in the possibility of using, right, nuclear weapons against ISIS?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'm never going to rule anything out.

MARK HALPERIN: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: And I wouldn't want to say -- even if I felt it wasn't going -- I wouldn't want to tell you that...

MARK HALPERIN: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: -- because, at a minimum, I want them to think maybe we would use it, OK?

MARK HALPERIN: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: It's the worst thing when we do these interviews, we -- with everybody, not me...

MARK HALPERIN: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: -- and you ask a question like that and everybody comes clean and they're so honest.

You know, we need unpredictability. The enemy, we have enemies. ISIS is a enemy. And it's an enemy not wearing uniforms, so we don't even know who the enemy is. You know, in the old days we'd have Japan or we'd have Germany or we'd have -- they would have soldiers.

MARK HALPERIN: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: They would be dressed, we'd be dressed, we'd know who we were fighting.

MARK HALPERIN: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: You'd have -- it was called a war.

We don't know who these people are. The fact is, we need unpredictability. And when you ask a question like that, it's a very -- it's a very sad thing to have to answer it, because the enemy is watching and I have a very good chance of winning and I frankly don't want the enemy to know how I'm thinking.

UNIDENTIFIED: Understood.

DONALD TRUMP: But with that being said, I don't rule out anything.

JOHN HEILEMANN: Right. Let me ask you, looking back, then, rather than looking forward, and maintaining unpredictability, have there been circumstances, provocations, in the past, let's say 15 years, when you -- if you had been president, would have considered using nuclear weapons?

For instance, after 9/11, would you have considered using nuclear weapons against the Taliban?

DONALD TRUMP: No. No.

JOHN HEILEMANN: No?

Why?

DONALD TRUMP: No. Well, first of all, we attacked the wrong country.

UNIDENTIFIED: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: We went after Iraq. Iraq did not knock down the World Trade Center.

JOHN HEILEMANN: Right. Well, that's why I asked about the Taliban.

DONALD TRUMP: I'm just saying, Iraq did -- no, because we could have taken out the Taliban without -- if we really wanted to do it.

UNIDENTIFIED: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: We didn't need nuclear weapons.

I would say definitely, nuclear weapons are a last resort. That I will say. I understand the power of nuclear weapons. I had an uncle for many years at MIT, a brilliant man. He used to tell me, 30 years ago, about the power of weaponry, but the power of nuclear and other things. And it's so devastating.

No, I -- I would say abso -- not, I would say absolutely as a last resort.

MARK HALPERIN: You're talking more and thinking more (INAUDIBLE)...

DONALD TRUMP: That doesn't mean we shouldn't be prepared and that doesn't mean our equipment shouldn't be prepared. And I'm not even sure it is prepared. I watched "60 Minutes " from about a year ago where they should have never put this on, that the administration should have never allowed it.

But they showed these nuclear weapons that are not in a state of preparedness. And I will tell you, I would never want to use them, but we have to be prepared and they have to be absolutely perfect.

MARK HALPERIN: You're talking more and thinking more about national security than you ever have, obviously.

DONALD TRUMP: It's true.

MARK HALPERIN: Are there -- what are the areas where you would like to learn more or where you think you need to know more to be president, about national security?

DONALD TRUMP: I've had a good instinct for national security...

MARK HALPERIN: I'm not asking...

DONALD TRUMP: -- so...

MARK HALPERIN: -- about your instincts, though.

DONALD TRUMP: No, no.

MARK HALPERIN: I'm asking about (INAUDIBLE)...

DONALD TRUMP: But it is.

MARK HALPERIN: (INAUDIBLE).

DONALD TRUMP: It's all about instinct.

MARK HALPERIN: Well, but -- but so you -- there's no area where you think you need to know more about...

DONALD TRUMP: I would say...

MARK HALPERIN: -- the Chinese leadership or...

DONALD TRUMP: -- I want to know more about everything in every area, OK. I want to know more about everything in every little area and every little corner. But I do think I have a very good instinct for this.

I said take the oil four years ago. If you go back, take the oil, take the oil. We shouldn't have been in Iraq. But I said now you're leaving, you've totally destabilized the Middle East. It's a total mess. Iran is going to take the oil, because Iran is -- you know, people don't realize Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world, and really good oil.

I said take the oil.

So now who has the oil?

ISIS has the oil and Iran is going to have all of the oil.

JOHN HEILEMANN: It's taken for granted in -- and for a long time, that the United States and that the president of the United States are the leaders of the free world.

All right, do you -- do you -- would you, if you were president of the United States, would you think of yourself as the leader of the free world?

DONALD TRUMP: I would.

JOHN HEILEMANN: You would?

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

UNIDENTIFIED: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: But that doesn't mean I'm going to spend trillions of dollars on nation-building.

UNIDENTIFIED: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: Because I think the days of nation-building have proven to be over.

JOHN HEILEMANN: Do you think America is the most powerful country on Earth right now?

DONALD TRUMP: I think that weapons are changing and all of a sudden the power of the weaponry is so incredible. Let me tell you, if -- if we weren't talking about the power of weapons, I would have been out of the Middle East -- I would have said if you're going in, you made a mistake, get out immediately, come out.

But you can't allow anybody to arm with the kind of weapons and the kind of power that can be produced today.

JOHN HEILEMANN: But you don't...

DONALD TRUMP: That's the problem.

JOHN HEILEMANN: -- but you talked earlier about how -- about the notion that we're losing to ISIL, that they're making us look foolish and soft...

DONALD TRUMP: ISIS...

(CROSSTALK)

Dare you say ISIS?

JOHN HEILEMANN: ISIS, ISIL (INAUDIBLE)...

DONALD TRUMP: You know, that's one thing with the president. He always says ISIL.

JOHN HEILEMANN: Whatever.

DONALD TRUMP: ISIL, ISIL, ISIL. Everyone else says ISIS. And it's almost like he does it to bother people, OK?

JOHN HEILEMANN: Well, I'm not...

DONALD TRUMP: You understand.

JOHN HEILEMANN: -- I'm not doing it to bother you, OK?

DONALD TRUMP: No, I know that. But...

JOHN HEILEMANN: I'm all...

DONALD TRUMP: -- but you know what -- but the president of the United States always says ISIL and everyone else says ISIS. And I actually think he does it to bother people (INAUDIBLE).

JOHN HEILEMANN: But when people say America is the most powerful country on Earth, they're talking about economics, they're talking about military, they're talking about everything, right.

So isn't the -- America right now the most powerful country on Earth...

DONALD TRUMP: I would...

JOHN HEILEMANN: Or is there someone more powerful?

DONALD TRUMP: I would say -- I would say people are catching up. I think China is catching up. I think Russia is catching up. I think, you know, you look at -- you look at our budgets, we've cut way back on the military. We have a military that needs help. We have a military that is -- the equipment is old.

I have a friend whose son is -- has spent quite a bit of time over in Iraq and Afghanistan and he said that our weapons aren't as good as the enemy, because they take the weapons as we give them to people. We give them to people that we think are fighting for us. A bullet's shot in the air and they run and the enemy takes over the weapons. And he's so disheartened when he sees that they have better weapons than we do and they're American weapons.

MARK HALPERIN: National security is going to be a big issue.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

MARK HALPERIN: You and Hillary Clinton are both way ahead in delegates now. So let's say it's a general election between the two of you.

She was the secretary of State, the nation's chief diplomat.

DONALD TRUMP: And did a poor job. I mean...

MARK HALPERIN: You're -- and you're...

DONALD TRUMP: -- look -- look what happened.

MARK HALPERIN: -- and you're -- her...

DONALD TRUMP: Look at Syria. Look at the job she did.

MARK HALPERIN: -- your -- you're a businessman...

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

MARK HALPERIN: -- and -- and hosted a TV show.

How do you win that argument at a time of a national security crisis?

DONALD TRUMP: I think we'll win it because I think people will see I'm much more competent than she is.

MARK HALPERIN: How do you prove to people...

DONALD TRUMP: I think I'm much smarter than she is. I think I'm much more competent than she is. And I think she's been very weak. And I don't think -- I -- I said it before, I don't think she has the strength or the stamina to be a good president.

MARK HALPERIN: So if the election is -- is...

DONALD TRUMP: And the call at 3:00 in the morning, I think she's sleeping and I don't think she wakes up.

MARK HALPERIN: So if the American people (INAUDIBLE)...

DONALD TRUMP: And that's been proven.

When you look at Hillary with that phony ad that she did, the 3:00 in the morning ad, she never woke up. The phone call was made. The ambassador, Benghazi, I mean the call was made many hundreds of times. They were calling and calling. She took -- she took Blumenthal's call, but she didn't take the call from the people she was -- so she was sleeping.

MARK HALPERIN: Do you think there's...

DONALD TRUMP: OK?

MARK HALPERIN: -- do you think there's anything she did while she was secretary of State that you think what -- was -- was good or (INAUDIBLE)?

DONALD TRUMP: Not that I can think of. No. Yes, she did one thing. She did a lot of traveling. I think she worked hard. She did a lot of traveling. She was always on planes going back and forth.

But she also lied. She said she was attacked and she came under attack. She was landing some place and she was under this vicious attack and the bullets.

It turned out to be a total fraud.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

MARK HALPERIN: We'll have more of our discussion with Donald Trump later in the program.

(BREAK)

Now for part number two of our conversation with Donald Trump from last night at Mar-a-Lago. We talked with him about what he was doing when he found out about yesterday's early attack in Brussels.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DONALD TRUMP: I was called by a friend. He said a terrible thing happened in Brussels. I'm not that surprised. Brussels, I've sort of been saying Brussels is a mess with what's going on.

And I turned on the television and I saw what was going on and I think it's deplorable.

MARK HALPERIN: In one of your interviews this morning, you talked about giving the country a pep talk is one of the things you would do.

When you talk about these issues, you tend to talk about them in negative ways. You say the terrorists are witnessing, some people are already in this country.

If you were president...

DONALD TRUMP: Well, they are winning. I mean, look, they're shutting down the world and we don't do anything about it and we're worried about laws. And we -- we can't waterboard and yet they're chopping off heads and drowning people in steel cages.

MARK HALPERIN: So that -- that's, again, I understand that's part of your view. But a pep talk implies optimism.

So if you were president speaking to the country right now, what would you say optimistically about winning the war on terror?

DONALD TRUMP: I'd be very optimistic and I'd be very tough on terror. I'd be much tougher than what we are right now. And I'd increase our laws so that we could -- I would expand our laws so that we could do certain things.

We're not playing on the same field. They have no laws. They have absolutely no laws. They kill people and they don't talk about it, they don't worry about the law.

We do something that's a little bit harsh and that particular soldier or general or whoever it may be loses his pension and loses his life.

We're not playing by the same rules. They're playing dirty stuff and we're not playing that way. We can't waterboard anymore. We can't do anything.

Now, waterboarding, nothing is nice about it. But they say it's a minimal form. Well, you know what, we have to go much tougher, because it's eating up the world now. And a lot of the world is weak. And they're weak and ineffective people.

What's happening in Germany is unbelievable. What's happening in a small part, even of Sweden, is unbelievable.

And a lot of people are saying Donald Trump was right. And you know that and I know that. And I don't want to be right about it. I'd actually rather be wrong about it. But I am right about it.

JOHN HEILEMANN: Senator Cruz came out today and said that he thought we should have police patrols in Muslim neighborhoods in the United States. I know you said that you thought that was a good idea in earlier interview today. You were 100 percent behind it.

We had Ryan Crocker on our show, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan. He said it's the worst idea you can imagine, that it would be exactly what ISIS would want us to do, because it would portray the United States as being indiscriminately prejudiced against Muslims.

So...

DONALD TRUMP: Can I...

JOHN HEILEMANN: -- how do you respond to -- to Ambassador Crocker's view on that?

DONALD TRUMP: I'm OK with it, all right. I'm OK. We have to be vigilant. We have to be careful. You know, in New York City, we had the strongest -- our police department, which is amazing people. We had the strongest -- if you talk about vigilance, we -- we were watching closer than anybody else and it was an amazing group and they actually caught people in terms of stopping attacks.

UNIDENTIFIED: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: And it was ended by a mayor who's grossly incompetent, de Blasio. We have an incompetent mayor of New York City, as you probably have heard.

And it was ended. They ended it, for no reason. They ended it. And we should bring it back.

We have to be vigilant. We have to look -- even if it's at the mosques. And I'm OK with it.

JOHN HEILEMANN: But I think you're not...

DONALD TRUMP: There's a problem. John, look, there's a problem.

JOHN HEILEMANN: No, I understand, but I think you're...

DONALD TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE).

JOHN HEILEMANN: -- I think you're not responding to the substance of the arguments. You're saying Ambassador Crocker is wrong that...

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

JOHN HEILEMANN: -- (INAUDIBLE) analysis but that ISIS would take that as a victory?

DONALD TRUMP: I would say he's wrong. I think we have to be much tougher, much smarter and much more vigilant.

JOHN HEILEMANN: OK. In your -- in your career, which has been, obviously, very successful, what are the -- we see an analogy, what's the kind of decision that you've had to make that -- in your career previously, that was the closest thing to the kind of a decision that a president has to make when he decides to send American forces into a conflict?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, nobody's made decisions like that. I mean, you're talking about lives. You're talking about potentially thousands of lives. But, you know, when you don't make decisions, oftentimes, you're talking about many more lives.

If we're going to be weak and ineffective, which is what we are right now -- I mean I watch -- as an example, I watched President Obama land in Cuba with nobody to greet him, in particular Castro, but nobody to greet him.

I thought that was terrible.

I then watched him at a press conference yesterday. It looked like he was a baby. Castro was the boss.

I then watched him today sitting at a baseball game in Cuba while people are -- body parts are laying all over a -- the place, with threats to us and threats to everybody else.

And I'm watching him sitting in the sun watching a baseball game.

UNIDENTIFIED: What a -- what...

DONALD TRUMP: I think it looks so bad. He could have left Cuba. He could have said, you know, this is an emergency. He should be back in Washington, in the White House where a president should be at a time like this.

It looks so bad.

MARK HALPERIN: What's the toughest decision you've made in your career?

DONALD TRUMP: I've made many tough decisions.

MARK HALPERIN: (INAUDIBLE).

DONALD TRUMP: I can't -- name one?

MARK HALPERIN: What's one that was really (INAUDIBLE).

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I mean I do multi-million dollar deals. I do multi-billion dollar deals.

MARK HALPERIN: (INAUDIBLE) one that was really tough.

DONALD TRUMP: Guaranteeing vast amounts of debt to do very large transactions, which takes courage. And they work out. And if they don't work out, I make them work out. I've taken deals that, frankly, shouldn't have worked out and I've made them very good deals. It wasn't pretty, but I've made them very good deals.

I mean I'll be building a massive building in a horrible -- and the market is great. And then the market turns bad. And I -- I'm very tough on banks. I'm very tough on every -- and I make them turn out.

And I do that very often, because very often, things don't work out the way you think they're going to work out. And that's the sign of a great businessperson. It's the sign of a great dealmaker, because things change. And it's how do you do in the bad times, not how do you do -- the good times are easy.

It's how do you do in the bad times?

MARK HALPERIN: You've talked at length about dealing with the border, dealing with ISIS. These are all relatively short-term issues.

If you were president four years, eight years, again, going back to this notion of being optimistic, you've talked about the Muslim world being at war with the West, what is the Trump plan, long-term, to try to make the relationship between the Muslim world and the Western world better?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, they have to respect us. They do not respect us at all. And frankly, they don't respect a lot of the things that are happening throughout not only our country, but they don't respect other things.

I think what Merkel has done to Germany is an outrage. I think the German people -- I know German people that are here all the time. You see them here all the time, people that love, love, love Germany. And people tell me two years ago they were saying it's the greatest country on Earth.

And now they're going to leave. They're going to leave Germany. I mean they're...

MARK HALPERIN: How would you...

DONALD TRUMP: -- they're literally talking (INAUDIBLE)...

MARK HALPERIN: -- how would you make the Muslim world like the West better?

DONALD TRUMP: I -- let -- let me just tell you, the first thing you have to do is get them to respect the West and respect us. And if they're not going to respect us, it's never going to work.

This has been going on for a long time. You know, I tell the story about General Pershing in 1918, where there were problems, where they had radical Islamic terrorism, OK, in 198 -- in the Philippines. And it's a well known story and I'm not going to go through the whole process.

But they had a huge problem with the terrorism having to do with Islam or having to do with radical Islam. And he was unbelievably harsh. I think you know the story. He was unbelievably harsh. And they didn't have the problem for 28 years.

MARK HALPERIN: So one element would be have -- have the -- people in the Islamic world respect the West more?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't think...

MARK HALPERIN: Are there any other elements?

DONALD TRUMP: -- I don't think you can do anything and I don't think you're going to be successful unless they respect you and they have no respect for our president and they have no respect for our country right now.

MARK HALPERIN: Let's talk about NATO. You've talked about NATO with "The Washington Post " editorial board...

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

MARK HALPERIN: -- and suggested maybe the U.S. should have a different role, a smaller role. You didn't say withdraw, as some people said, but a different role and then NATO might need a different type of mission.

There are people who say that America needs to be the leader of NATO, that that's an important role.

Do you agree...

DONALD TRUMP: Hey...

MARK HALPERIN: -- America should be the leader of NATO?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, we're paying a very disproportionate share. We're paying for a lot of NATO. And it's helping them more than it's helping us.

Look, I look at Ukraine and we're always the leader.

What about the countries surrounding it?

They don't even say anything. We're always fighting. We're -- we're the one that wants to go to World War III with Russia over Ukraine.

So we're the ones that are always fighting. We're the ones putting up a lot of the money for NATO, disproportionately a lot.

MARK HALPERIN: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: Now, we put up a lot of the money for a lot of countries. You know, we defend South Korea. We defend Saudi Arabia. We defend Japan. We defend Germany.

MARK HALPERIN: But would you...

DONALD TRUMP: We put up a lot of money and then people wonder, I wonder why we owe $19 trillion, OK?

I mean we put up a lot of money for a lot of -- when you look at our military budget, it's very interesting. And everyone sees it's many, many times higher than the second one.

But it's not really for us. It's because we're defending everybody else. We're defending the whole world.

MARK HALPERIN: All right. So should America be the leader of NATO...

DONALD TRUMP: I think...

MARK HALPERIN: -- or not necessarily?

DONALD TRUMP: -- I think NATO may be obsolete. NATO was set up a long time ago, many, many years ago, when things were different. Things are different now. We were a rich nation then. We had nothing but money. We had nothing but power and -- and, you know, far more than we have today in a true sense.

And I think NATO, you have to really examine NATO. And it doesn't really help us. It's helping other countries. And I don't think those other countries appreciate what we're doing.

JOHN HEILEMANN: So just to be clear, again, you -- you made two slightly different arguments there. I just want to clarify.

One of them is that the U.S. -- that you might want to see the U.S. pay less money into NATO because you (INAUDIBLE)...

DONALD TRUMP: That one definitely.

JOHN HEILEMANN: That's definitely.

DONALD TRUMP: That one definitely.

JOHN HEILEMANN: But it's possible that NATO is obsolete...

DONALD TRUMP: It's possible.

JOHN HEILEMANN: -- and -- and should be gotten rid of?

DONALD TRUMP: It's possible. I would certainly look at it.

JOHN HEILEMANN: OK.

DONALD TRUMP: And I'd want more help from other people and the one thing definitely, we're paying too much, OK?

As to whether or not it's obsolete, I will make that determination.

MARK HALPERIN: Our thanks to Donald Trump and his team down in Florida.
