DONALD TRUMP: After massive defeats in Arizona, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Delaware, Connecticut and Maryland, (in addition to twenty other contests) and given the fact that Senator Cruz has millions of votes less than me and is being clobbered on the delegate front, this is a pure waste of time. It reminds me very much of the already failed Kasich "collusion", a desperate attempt to save a failing campaign by an all-talk, no-action politician. The people of Indiana are very smart andthey will see through this just like they saw through the already failed Kasich alliance. Cruz has no path to victory. He is only trying to stay relevant.
