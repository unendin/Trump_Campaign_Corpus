DONALD TRUMP: Yet another terrorist attack today in Israel -- a father, shot at by a Palestinian terrorist, was killed while driving his car and three of his children who were passengers were severely injured. As I did with regard to the brutal murder of Hallel Yaffa Ariel, I strongly condemn this attack and call upon the Palestinian leadership to completely end this barbaric behavior. I also call upon President Obama to recognize and condemn each and every terrorist attack against Israeli citizens. This cannot become the "new normal." It has to end.
