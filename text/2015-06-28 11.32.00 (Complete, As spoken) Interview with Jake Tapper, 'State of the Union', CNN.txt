JAKE TAPPER: Welcome back to STATE OF THE UNION. The race for 2016 now: a shock to the body politic this week, with Donald Trump showing real strength in a series of polls. Our latest CNN poll shows him in second place in New Hampshire, trailing only Jeb Bush. Another poll has that same result nationally among Republicans.

Love him or hate him, the mega-millionaire real estate developer and reality TV star is now an actual contender for the Republican nomination.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

In 2000, when you were flirting with running as a Reform Party candidate, you wrote that you're a liberal on health care, and you supported a Canadian-style system, where the government acts as an insurer.

Is that what you still believe in?

DONALD TRUMP: You know, I looked at that. I looked at it very seriously.

I do believe, and I -- some people don't agree with me on this. I want everyone to have coverage. I do want people to have coverage. I think that a great forum could be -- and I love the free market. I love the way it works. But we never had a free market. Even before Obamacare, it wasn't really free market.

As an example, we're in New York right now. And when I wanted to bid out my health insurance and all sorts of things, we had boundaries. I could only go in New York. If I wanted to bid it out to a company from California or New Jersey, anywhere, I mean, and I was getting like -- you get no bids.

JAKE TAPPER: But the single payer, no more, you're not interested in...

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: No. No.

And, you know, there are different times. And over the years, you are going to change your attitudes.

JAKE TAPPER: Sure.

DONALD TRUMP: You're going to learn things and you're going to change. And I have evolved on that issue. I have evolved on numerous issues.

JAKE TAPPER: Let me ask you about China, because, as you may or may not know, this is a Trump tie.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

JAKE TAPPER: I bought it for this interview.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, and not only that. I mean, I buy a lot of stuff, because...

JAKE TAPPER: But, as you know, they're made in China.

DONALD TRUMP: Very beautiful tie, though.

JAKE TAPPER: It's a lovely tie.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

JAKE TAPPER: It's made in China.

DONALD TRUMP: Correct.

JAKE TAPPER: Is it hypocritical at all for you to talk about this...

DONALD TRUMP: No, not at all, not at all.

JAKE TAPPER: ... while you're manufacturing your clothes in...

DONALD TRUMP: No.

And I buy -- I'm building the old post office. And I just made an order from China, because they have cut their currency to such, I have an -- I'm a private person. I may not be a private person for long. Who knows. We will see what happens.

JAKE TAPPER: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: I talk about my ties in speeches.

JAKE TAPPER: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: You know, I'm open. I say, my ties, many times, are made in China, not all of them, by the way, but a lot of them are made in China, because they have manipulated their currency to such a point that it's impossible for our companies to compete.

JAKE TAPPER: When it comes to outsourcing jobs, which is what this tie would be a representative issue of, one of the issues is that the people in China, the laborers, are paid a lot less and the standards are worse when it comes to the environment and health care and worker safety.

DONALD TRUMP: Many problems. I agree with that.

JAKE TAPPER: Isn't that what -- but what do you say when somebody says, well, why don't you -- why don't you be a leader and make these in Philadelphia? I would be willing to pay more for this tie.

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: You would. And, unfortunately, you would see that it's very, very hard to have anything in apparel made in this country. Do you know how much is made outside of the country?

JAKE TAPPER: Most of it.

DONALD TRUMP: And now...

JAKE TAPPER: But some of them...

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: ... Vietnam, so many other places.

JAKE TAPPER: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: The problem...

JAKE TAPPER: American -- American Apparel makes stuff here.

DONALD TRUMP: And just so you understand, I know you bring that up, but I put ties in my speeches.

JAKE TAPPER: It just seems interesting, because you dinged Ford for manufacturing their cars in Mexico.

DONALD TRUMP: I do. No, no, no, I don't ding them. I say, congratulations. I think it's a great deal, but I wouldn't let you do it. I wouldn't let them manipulate their currency, because that's what they do.

JAKE TAPPER: Back in 2012, you tweeted -- quote -- "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive."

DONALD TRUMP: Well, of course I'm being sarcastic, you know. I love to...

(CROSSTALK)

JAKE TAPPER: That's not to be taken seriously?

DONALD TRUMP: No, it's a little bit serious. There's a little bit of seriousness there.

Look, we are restricting our factories much more than China. I go to China. They have factories that are much more competitive. I'm not saying friendly, but they're certainly not environmentally friendly. I'm a huge believer in clean air. I'm not a huge believer in the global warming phenomena.

JAKE TAPPER: But the overwhelming majority of scientists say it's real and it's manmade, and things are happening. Well, there could be -- there could be some manmade, too. I mean, I'm not saying there's zero, but not nearly to the extent.

When Obama gets up and said it's the number one problem of our country -- and, if it is, why is it that we have to do our and clean up our factories now, and China doesn't have to do it for another 30 or 35 years in their wonderful agreement, you know, our wonderful negotiators?

They have much smarter, much better negotiators than we do. It's really as simple as that. We don't have -- and that's part of the reason I'm doing this, because...

Because you're a man that wrote "The Art of the Deal."

DONALD TRUMP: I did write "The Art of the Deal, " in all fairness.

And a lot of people -- the administration hasn't read it, obviously. But we have horrible trade deals.

JAKE TAPPER: So, you would tear up NAFTA, tear up the...

DONALD TRUMP: I think NAFTA has been a disaster. I think NAFTA has been a disaster.

I think our current deals are a disaster. And I'm a free trader. The problem with free trade is, you need smart people representing you. We have the greatest negotiators in the world, but we don't use them. We use political hacks and diplomats. We use the wrong people.

Mexico is smart. They have outnegotiated us to a fare-thee-well. They're going to be the capital of automobiles pretty soon, the way they're going. I respect what they're doing. I think it's great. I like Mexico. I love the Mexican people. I do business with the Mexican people.

But you have people coming through the border that are from all over. And they're bad. They're really bad. I have spoken to border guards, and I said, how bad is it? They said, Mr. Trump, you have no idea how bad. You have people coming in -- and I'm not just saying Mexicans. I'm talking about people that are from all over that are killers and rapists. And, I mean, they're coming into this country.

JAKE TAPPER: Let me talk to you about that for one second. The government of Mexico called those comments prejudicial and absurd.

And I think that what they're objecting to is the idea that, of the 11 million undocumented workers, illegal immigrants, whatever you want to call them, in this country, that you're painting them with a very broad brush, rapists, criminals, when that's probably a very small percentage.

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: No, no. Well, I don't think it's a small percentage. It's a lot. But it's not Mexicans, necessarily. They're coming from all over.

JAKE TAPPER: You talked about building a wall and having Mexico pay for it.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

JAKE TAPPER: How exactly are you going to get Mexico to pay for it?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, the way -- look, Mexico has not treated us well. Mexico treats us as though we are stupid people, which, of course, our leaders are.

I don't blame Mexico. China's even worse.

JAKE TAPPER: But how do you force a country to build a wall?

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, you force them because we give Mexico a fortune. Mexico makes a fortune because of us.

We -- a wall is a tiny little peanut compared to the kind of money...

JAKE TAPPER: So, you would cut off business or impose tariffs unless they built the wall?

DONALD TRUMP: I would do something very severe unless they contributed or gave us the money to build the wall. I would build it. I would build it very nicely. I'm very good at building things.

JAKE TAPPER: Can we talk about ISIS for one second?

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

JAKE TAPPER: The -- I think you said that you want to bomb the oil fields in Iraq...

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

JAKE TAPPER: ... to take on ISIS?

DONALD TRUMP: The only way you're going to beat them is that. You know why they're rich? Because they have the oil. Now, if you remember...

JAKE TAPPER: They have the oil in Syria, though.

DONALD TRUMP: They have some oil in Iraq.

JAKE TAPPER: There's a refinery that they're fighting with the Iraqis over.

DONALD TRUMP: They're fighting, and they're going to get it. They're fighting with Iraq. They're going to get it. When are the -- the Iraqis will throw up their arms, they will leave, and they have -- it's just one of those things.

JAKE TAPPER: But I don't think Iraq -- I don't think the government of Iraq would want us to bomb their oil fields.

DONALD TRUMP: The government of Iraq? There is no government in Iraq. The so-called government in Iraq went to Iran to meet with Iran. Iran is going to take over Iraq. That's as simple as that. OK? As simple as that.

JAKE TAPPER: I don't know that Iraq, the government of Iraq, or whatever you want to call them, would support our bombing the oil fields in Iraq since...

DONALD TRUMP: Who cares?

JAKE TAPPER: OK.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't care about the government of Iraq. They're corrupt. The government -- the government of Iraq is totally corrupt. Who cares?

JAKE TAPPER: Let me ask you about a few social issues...

DONALD TRUMP: OK.

(CROSSTALK)

JAKE TAPPER: ... just because I'm not -- they haven't been issues you have been talking about for several years.

I know you're opposed to abortion.

DONALD TRUMP: Right. I'm pro-choice.

JAKE TAPPER: You're pro-choice or pro-life?

DONALD TRUMP: I'm pro-life. I'm sorry.

JAKE TAPPER: Pro-life.

So, how important is that issue to you now? When President Trump picks Supreme Court justices, would that be a litmus test?

DONALD TRUMP: It is. It is.

Look, you have a lot of pro-choice people out there. But that is an issue, it's very interesting, because, in terms of polling, the pro-choice is actually going down a little bit. You know, it's very interesting.

JAKE TAPPER: Let's talk about same-sex marriage. You said a few years ago that you were evolving on that issue.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

(CROSSTALK)

JAKE TAPPER: Where are you?

DONALD TRUMP: I'm traditional marriage. It is changing rapidly.

JAKE TAPPER: But what do you say to a lesbian who's married, or a gay man who is married, who says, Donald Trump, what's traditional about being married three times?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, they have a very good point.

But, you know, I have been a very hardworking person. I have had -- actually, I have a great marriage. I have a great wife now. And I -- my two wives were very good. And I don't blame them. But I was working, maybe like you, 22 hours a day.

JAKE TAPPER: I'm not asking you to explain your divorces, but -- but...

DONALD TRUMP: No, I know. No, I'm just saying it was -- I blame myself because my business was so powerful for me. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

JAKE TAPPER: But what do you say to a lesbian or a gay man who are married, and say...

DONALD TRUMP: I really don't say anything.

JAKE TAPPER: OK.

DONALD TRUMP: I mean, I'm just -- I'm just -- Jake, I'm for traditional marriage.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

JAKE TAPPER: I want to note that the interview with Mr. Trump took place before the Supreme Court issued its ruling on same-sex marriage Friday. He said afterwards that he would have preferred that the high court leave the issue to the states.

Our interview with the Donald is not done yet. Polls show he is hot on the heels of Republican front-runner Jeb Bush, and he has a lot to say about Mr. Bush.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP: I really think he's a nice man. I think he's a wonderful man.

I don't know if I want him negotiating with ISIS. I think Trump will do a lot better. You think so too, but you're not going to say it.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

JAKE TAPPER: Welcome back. The so-called 11th commandment, often erroneously attributed to Ronald Reagan, decrees to Republican candidates, thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican. Now, plenty of folks have flouted that rule, but perhaps none with as much relish as one Mr. Donald Trump, taking notable aim at Jeb Bush, who is just ahead of him in the latest polls.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

You seem to really be taking on Jeb Bush in particular in your campaign appearances. Why is that?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't mean to.

And I have been told that by others. I was actually told that by my wife. And I don't mean to, because I think he's a nice person. I watch him. I think he's a nice person.

And I actually felt bad, because I hit him very hard one day, and I said, why am I hitting him so hard?

JAKE TAPPER: His approach to you seems to be not taking you seriously, his campaign not taking you seriously.

DONALD TRUMP: Trust me, he takes me seriously.

JAKE TAPPER: You think so? Because I was going to say, what is -- what is your message to Jeb Bush?

DONALD TRUMP: We have been contacted.

My message is, I think he's a wonderful person. And I look forward to seeing him.

JAKE TAPPER: No, but in terms of him not taking you seriously, what do you say?

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, I -- you know he takes me seriously. And his people have -- believe me, he takes me seriously.

JAKE TAPPER: Why do you say that?

DONALD TRUMP: Because they call.

JAKE TAPPER: And what do they say?

DONALD TRUMP: What would you think?

JAKE TAPPER: Stop it, stop attacking Jeb?

DONALD TRUMP: They -- you know what? They take me so seriously, and they do call and they write. And just believe me, they take me very seriously.

JAKE TAPPER: OK.

DONALD TRUMP: But, with all of that being said, I really think he's a nice man. I think he's a wonderful man.

I don't know if I want him negotiating with ISIS. I think Trump will do a lot better. You think so too, but you're not going to say it.

JAKE TAPPER: Well, I don't know if anybody who is going to negotiate with ISIS.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, you could bring them to a point. Look, the whole ISIS thing has to be ended. It's got to be stopped. We have to stop that. What's going on over there is incredible.

JAKE TAPPER: Let me ask about the other side of the aisle, Hillary Clinton. I was surprised to read that Hillary actually went to your wedding.

DONALD TRUMP: She did.

JAKE TAPPER: She went to your wedding. And I know you have contributed to her campaigns in the past. You have said that her husband is the best post-Reagan president. Well, I can't go with Bush. And senior Bush, I really liked. But "Read my lips, " I couldn't stand it.

Are you -- are you still in touch with the Clintons?

DONALD TRUMP: No, I'm not. I'm not at all, actually, no.

JAKE TAPPER: How do you -- are you worried at all that somebody who has given money to Hillary, she was at your wedding, that...

DONALD TRUMP: No. I give money to everybody.

JAKE TAPPER: But that Republican voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina might be concerned about that?

DONALD TRUMP: No. No. In fact, a lot of people like it.

You know, we have gridlock in Washington. For instance, I have helped Nancy Pelosi. I have helped Reid. I have -- I'm a business.

JAKE TAPPER: Right. You gave money to -- to Reid and Pelosi to help recapture Congress in 2006.

DONALD TRUMP: Hey, Jake, Jake, I'm a -- I'm a business. You know, I was in business. I built a great company. They always treated me nicely.

We need that in Washington. We have total gridlock.

JAKE TAPPER: So, you will argue to voters, yes, I gave money to Reid and Pelosi to help recapture Congress in 2006.

DONALD TRUMP: I'm a business. You know, I was in business. I built a great company. They always treated me nicely. We need that in Washington. We have total gridlock.

JAKE TAPPER: So you will argue to voters, yes, I gave money to Reid and Pelosi to help recapture Congress but this is what we need, more bipartisan --

DONALD TRUMP: I'm a conservative Republican. I'm a very conservative person, actually. But I get along with everybody. I would be more successful in beating Hillary, assuming that she gets it, which I think she probably will. Although --

JAKE TAPPER: Who knows?

DONALD TRUMP: Who knows? I mean if you go back a few years she was going to get it before Obama came along.

JAKE TAPPER: Sure.

DONALD TRUMP: That was -- you know, that was like a dead -- that was a done deal.

JAKE TAPPER: You think Bernie Sanders can beat her?

DONALD TRUMP: Well he's making a lot of progress. You know, you would have said and I've watched him and -- you know, I've seen his crowds. I get crowds that are fantastic, too. He's got that. I mean, he has got a lot of people going to see him.

Do I think so? No I don't think so. But you know, stranger -- hey, you've been in this world a long time.

JAKE TAPPER: Absolutely.

DONALD TRUMP: Stranger things have happened.

JAKE TAPPER: Some people look at you running for president and say, this is just about ego. It's just about getting his brand out there.

What's your message to those people?

DONALD TRUMP: My message is that they're wrong. It's something that I've looked at over the years. I looked at it very seriously as you know four years ago. I've been thinking about it very seriously over the last period of time. And I've decided I'm going to do it. And --

JAKE TAPPER: And you're in it to win it. You're serious.

DONALD TRUMP: I'm in it to win it.

Look, I give up a lot. I give up hundreds of millions of dollars in deals and potential -- you know, things that I do. In all fairness, I don't want to sound trivial; NBC renewed "The Apprentice " because we had a great season last season. And they would love me not to be doing this. I will tell you right now. I mean, the top people come to my office and they say, please do this -- I'm not doing it because of this. I can't do it. I'm not allowed to do it. Essentially, legally I'm not allowed to do it. But "The Apprentice " -- I give up "The Apprentice." These politicians, Jake, I see them all the time. I mean, I'm with them now. They run. They lose. They win. They -- all they do is run. They don't lose anything. They help themselves.

I'm giving up hundreds of millions of dollars. Forget about what it cost. That's peanuts. The peanuts. The cheapest part is what it costs to do it. I'm giving up hundreds of millions of dollars to do this. I'm giving up a prime-time television show. I'm giving that up to do this. I'm a little blunt, but --

JAKE TAPPER: Just a little.

DONALD TRUMP: But you know what? Maybe that's what we need. We have to take it back. We have to take our country back.

We've lost our jobs. We've lost our money. We're a third world nation and we're a debtor nation at the same time.

You need somebody with the kind of thinking -- I built a great company. I have some of the great assets of the world. And I talk about that only from the -- not bragging. I talk about it because that's the mentality that this country needs. We need that mentality now. And we need it fast.

JAKE TAPPER: Donald Trump, thank you so much for spending time with us.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much.
