DONALD TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you Bobby. What a man.

(APPLAUSE) Nine-hundred victories Bobby had. Three national championships, last undefeated team, Olympics, PanAm games, Bobby Knight. Thank you Bobby. You know when I wanted to win the great state of Indiana. A friend of mine said, anyway you can get Bobby Knight to endorse you. When I got Bobby Knight, that was the end of that, I'll tell you what. In eight days, we are going to win the great state of Michigan and we are going to win back the White House.

(APPLAUSE)

Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. It's a disaster.

(APPLAUSE)

It's just been announced that Michigan residents are going to experience a massive double digit premium hike in Obamacare.

(BOOING)

I will not tell you the number. I know the number, but I want everybody to leave her happy. But you'll be happy because we'll repeal it. We'll replace it. We're going to get you something so good. So much less expensive. So much better --

(AUDIO GAP)

-- activity. The one who engaged in a corrupt pay for play scheme at the State Department. And now there are five FBI probes into the Clinton Foundation and their pay for play activities. Hillary is the one who sent and received classified information on an insecure server putting the safety of the American people under threat. Hillary is the one who lied to Congress under oath. She lied about turning over her work related emails. She lied about sending classified information. And she lied about using only one device. In other words, she lied. Man, is she a liar.

(BOOING)

Man does she lie. Alright. Get them out of here. Get them out.

(BOOING)

A paid protestor. A paid protestor.

(BOOING)

(USA. USA. USA)

Did you see on WikiLeaks? Oh, the great thing, look the cameras are actually looking over there finally.

(APPLAUSE)

They never want to show the massive crowds that we have. Look at that. Did you see where, on WikiLeaks, it was announced that they were paying protestors to be violent, $1,500.

(BOOING)

I wonder if that's one of them. No, he doesn't look to violent to me. Doesn't look violent to me. Hillary is the one who lied to the FBI and then pretended she couldn't remember 39 different times. Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer.

(BOOING)

Hillary destroyed 33,000 emails after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress, think of that one. I have a feeling in the 650,000 you're going to find the 33,000, it's looking like.

(APPLAUSE)

And it just came out. To me this is so bad. It's so bad. But it just came out. Did you see Donna Brazile was fired from the network?

(APPLAUSE)

For giving, for giving Crooked Hillary the answers and the questions to a debate.

(BOOING)

But the media, which is one of the most dishonest groups of people ever, ever, ever, you're ever going to meet.

(BOOING)

They don't say, who cares about Donna Brazile. Who cares? What I care about is Hillary Clinton gets the questions to a debate. That's a big deal. And then what happens is the media, they never say, why didn't you turn it in? Why did you use those questions? She used the questions, now on numerous occasions. Because this just came out today. This is in addition to the other day. So nobody's saying, why did Hillary Clinton not turn it in? You know I have a son named Baron. And I want to tell you, she is a terrible example for my son and for the children in this country. That I can tell you.

(APPLAUSE)

Hillary's the one who broke the law over, and over, and over again. And by the way, we don't forget. We do want the answer to that question media. Ask her. Why didn't she say that she had the questions to the debate? I hope you're going to be able to give us that answer.

(BOOING)

They're worse than she is.

(BOOING) By the way, did you see another one. Another one came in today. This WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove. Another one came in today. Where various networks, a lot of them, were sending stories and sending what do you want us to say here? What do you want to say there? What should we do here? What should we do there?

(BOOING)

Do you believe it?

(BOOING)

It's a rigged system folks. And a big part of the rigging is the media. I will tell you right now. It's a big part of the rigging. Big part of the rigging.

(BOOING)

It's a big part of the rigging. Among the most dishonest people you'll ever meet. Hillary is not the victim. The American people are the victims of this corrupt and rigged system. And on November 8th, that's your chance, we are going to change it.

(APPLAUSE)

Hillary Clinton is a dishonest person. And you know what? It all shows at so many things. But getting, I'm serious about this. Because somebody said, oh, maybe that's not that big a deal. To me it's a big deal. Getting the questions to the debate, that's a big deal. That's a big deal. And not turning yourself in. And if they fired Donna Brazile, why aren't they firing Hillary Clinton? Why is she allowed to run?

(APPLAUSE)

Hillary Clinton is unfit and unqualified to be the President of the United States. And she's likely to be under investigation for criminality for a very, very long time to come. One of her long time supporters, a top Democratic pollster and a very respected man, Doug Shone is now withdrawing his support from Hillary Clinton.

(APPLAUSE)

He wrote a recent article. He said, I'm a Democrat. I work for Bill Clinton. But I can't vote for Hillary. He went on, I'm now convinced. So important, folks this is so important. Because our country has enough problems. He said, I'm not convinced that we will be facing the very possibility of a Constitutional crisis with many dimensions and you know this is so true, deleterious consequences should Secretary Clinton win this election. In other words, we're going to be tied up in court for the rest of our lives with this deal. She's not going to win the election. But I'm just saying.

(APPLAUSE)

If Hillary is elected. She would be under protracted criminal investigation, likely followed by the trial of a sitting president. This is just, hey, this is just what we need. Just what we need. And let me tell you folks, let me tell you the way life is. They just found the 650,000 emails. One email, one email being classified or confidential, one out of 650,000, I guarantee you there are many. Many of the emails that were missing are in there. Thank you Huma. Thank you Huma.

(APPLAUSE)

Do you think right now that Hillary Clinton is happy with the services of Huma? I don't think so. I don't think she likes Huma. And I never thought we'd be saying thank you to Anthony Weiner. Never.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you Anthony. I never liked you Anthony. I never liked you but thank you very much. And I don't know. They don't give me much credit. But it's called good judgment. Do you notice I've been calling Anthony Weiner for the last year? And I've been saying. You can't allow somebody so close to the seat of power to be in anyway associated with this guy. And you know what the press said, how dare you say that. That's such a horrible -- -- give me a break. Now they're all saying. He was right. But most of them don't want to write it.

(APPLAUSE)

The investigation will last for years. Nothing will get done. Government will grind to a halt. And our country will continue to suffer. Hillary's corruption is a threat to democracy. And the only way to stop it is for you, on November 8th, to show up at the polls and vote. We'll stop it fast.

(APPLAUSE)

And you know what folks? We have a movement the likes they've never seen in this country. All of these dishonest people back there. They even say it. It's the greatest such event. I mean they say, they say, Bill O'Reilly said. They all say, it's the single greatest political phenomomena, Bill O'Reilly said, in his life. Now he's a tough guy. He's a smart guy. But it's the single greatest political phenomena in his life. And others have said the same thing. Even people who hate me have said the same thing. And by the way, just a little bit of news. You know you've been seeing polls. So we're winning almost everywhere.

(APPLAUSE)

And the reason I'm here, you know a Republican hasn't won in 35 years or something in the state of Michigan. But remember this, I've been with you for 2 years. I've been making speeches in Michigan for two years. And you know, outside, we have more people, this place is packed. Right? Look at the door. Outside, thank you to the fire marshal by the way, he was great. But outside, we have more people than we have inside. There's thousands of people outside.

But, I've been talking to the people of Michigan for two years. I've been saying it for five or six years. But I've been making speeches up here for two years, about your automobile industry, and other industries. But in particular, your automobile industry being sucked into Mexico.

(BOOING)

You know Ford just announced their big withdraw. They're going to make all their smaller cars in Mexico. They, that's on top of a plant that they just finished, $2.5 billion plant they just finished.

(BOOING)

Folks, I've been talking about this problem for years. She comes up, I've been talking about it for many years. It's been happening for many years. But I've been talking about it for years. But I've been making, who has been like at my speeches over the last couple of years up in Michigan?

(APPLAUSE)

Is that right? I'm telling you. And you know, I'll tell you again. Right now, as we're here, you have the leaders of companies negotiating right this second to make deals to move out into Mexico and other countries.

(BOOING)

And if I win, they can forget it. Those deals aren't worth the paper they're written on.

(APPLAUSE)

So we had some great polls. Now Michigan hasn't been, what is it like 35 years or something like that. No Republican has won since like Reagan, or something, many years ago. And I said, I love Michigan. And I saw numbers. No. No. I also said look, I'm the one, like I predicted Huma. I predicted take the oil. I predicted a lot of things. You've been seeing it.

(BOOING)

Hillary has bad judgment and bad instincts. How about this guy Podesta? Podesta, he's a nasty guy. Every thing he says about Hillary is so bad. He said she has terrible instincts. But we have good instincts.

And I've been saying, your car industry is being sucked away from Michigan. It's happening. If I'm elected, you won't lose one plant. You'll have plants coming into this country. You're going to have jobs again. You won't lose one plant. I promise you. I promise you that. (APPLAUSE) And if Ford and the other ones haven't started building their plant, they'll be back. Believe me. Before they start building their plant. Believe me. But the polls have been great. So what happened is Michigan hasn't been won in many, many years, decades. And I said, well wait a minute, why aren't I doing well in Michigan? They said, you are. You're even. I said, even? Even? Why am I even? See my people, because Michigan hasn't been won in decades, they thought even was good. I don't think even's good. I'm going to bring your jobs back folks. Hillary doesn't have clue. And she's going to have bigger problems than bringing your jobs back. I'll tell you.

But she doesn't have a clue. She's not bringing anything back. She's the one that let them go. Her and the group, they let them go. You know, during the debate, did I win the debates by the way? Won the debates easily. But during the debates, she'd say, I'm going to get ISIS. I'm going to this, I'm going to that. I'm -- -- I kept saying, why did you do it? Donald Trump used the tax code to his advantage. So change it. Why didn't you change it? Why didn't you change, change it? Right? Change it. Change the tax code.

(APPLAUSE)

But she wouldn't do that, because all of her rich guys that are supporting her, they're no different than me. They do the same thing. So she's not going to change anything. You know it's called a politician. All talk, no action. So what happens, I get this poll and it says we're doing well in Michigan. Well, not for me well, but for all the geniuses that work for me. They said, oh well you're even in Michigan. So I say, let's go to Michigan. We just left, we just left another place. I said let's go and win it.

(APPLAUSE)

Because I will bring your jobs back. And I will keep companies from leaving Michigan, firing the workers, opening plants in Mexico and other places. And if they do, like in Indiana, Carrier Air Conditioning. You have Ford here. You have so -- -- I could name -- -- I could name companies all day long. Right? We lost 70,000 factories since, essentially NAFTA. Who would believe 70,000? But here's the story, if they want to leave your great state. If Carrier as an example, is going to leave Indianapolis, Indiana.

If you're going to lose your car companies. And you're going to lose them. Believe me. You're going to lose them. You're losing them as we speak. I'm going to tell them very simply. Here's the story. Enjoy Mexico. A little hot. I like the people. I met with the President a few months ago. Good guy. But if you think you're going to fire all your workers in Michigan. You're going to open up a car plant in Mexico. Nice new factory, good luck. And then you're going to make cars and you're going to across, what will be a very, very strong powerful border, believe me.

(APPLAUSE)

I'm going to tell them. I'm going to tell them. There will be consequences. There will be consequences. (BUILD THAT WALL. BUILD THAT WALL. BUILD THAT WALL.)

Thank you. By the way, I'm going to talk about the wall a little later. But just to keep you not in suspense, we will build -- build the wall. Mexico will pay for the wall. Believe me. 100 percent. So I thought I'd come here and they all said, don't do that, 32 years, 35. I said, I'm going to win Michigan. I'm telling you. I'm the only one that's going to bring their business back. I'm the only one that's going to get rid of all these ridiculous regulations. I'm the only one that's cutting taxes. She's raising taxes. And in all fairness to the companies, they're fleeing because of taxes. We're the highest taxed country in the world. I said, I'm going to win Michigan. So, let's see what happens. Let's see what happens.

(APPLAUSE)

Now, on a nationwide basis, we're winning nationally. We're winning in Ohio. We're winning in Iowa. We're winning in North Carolina. That one just came in.

(APPLAUSE)

We're winning big in Florida. We're winning by four points in Florida.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, they give you phony polls folks. Phony polls. So I've been hearing about Texas. Texas and I, we have a great relationship. But they're saying, Texas is close. Texas, so the other day, I'm watching one of the networks, and a guy calls in, great guy, Sid Miller. I don't know Sid Miller. Got a big cowboy hat on, great guy. Big white cowboy hat, I said, where did you get that hat? And he calls in, he goes, you know I don't know what you people are talking about. But I'm from Texas. And we have more voting than I've ever seen in my life, early voting. He said, they're coming from all over the state. We've never seen some of them before. They haven't voted in 20 years. Some of them haven't even voted at all. And they've got Trump stickers on them and shirts and hats. And he said, -- --

(APPLAUSE)

- -- now you're saying it's close in Texas. But you're a bunch of liars. It's not close. This is a total wipeout in Texas. And that's what I -- -- that's what I thought.

(APPLAUSE)

And by the way, the same exact thing is happening in the great state of Florida. Florida, they have lines that are four blocks long. If you went there four years ago, there were like two people waiting to vote, and they're falling asleep. They have lines that are four and five blocks long. I passed one two days ago. I was in Florida. And I said, what's going on over there? I thought it was like a concert. It's people waiting for hours and hours to vote. So there's a great thing happening in our country folks.

(APPLAUSE)

It's called common sense. It's called build up our depleted military. We need it so badly now.

(APPLAUSE)

It's called save our 2nd Amendment.

(APPLAUSE)

When we close the chapter on the Clintons, we can open a bright new chapter focused on the American people. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to restore honesty and accountability to government. Have to have it.

(APPLAUSE)

I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words that we, not me, that we have to say. When we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. And we are going to drain the swamp.

(APPLAUSE)

Drain the swamp. You know I told a couple of groups that -- -- that started like a week ago. I hated it. It sounded so hokey. Drain the swamp. You have to be kidding. Drain the swamp. So I said, you know what, maybe I'll try it. So I was with a big, big group, a tremendous group of people, actually in New Hampshire. And I said, drain the swamp, the place went crazy. So I liked it a little better. Then I did it again and again. And now everyone's screaming when are we draining the swamp. What are we -- -- and I tell the story. I knew Frank Sinatra.

(DRAIN THE SWAMP. DRAIN THE SWAMP. DRAIN THE SWAMP.)

Frank Sinatra had "My Way". Didn't like it. Didn't like it. Then he sang it. People loved it. He sang it again, people loved it. Then it goes out and becomes a number one song all of a sudden he loved it. That's with me, drain the swamp. I love it. Well it's very descriptive. Because it is. It's a dirty, rotten, stinking swamp. WikiLeaks, and this you just saw. WikiLeaks also just released an email with Bill Clinton's chief of staff, telling John Podesta, foreign government donors dash all the money is in.

(BOOING)

That should be, you know what? That should be our next phrase. All the money is in. All the money -- -- this is from foreign governments. He doesn't mean taxes. He means the money going into their bank accounts. All the money is in. That's pretty good. I like that one. All the money is in. So that was just another one of WikiLeaks. And I'll tell you what. But they are nasty to Hillary. You know, for a person that's supposed to be a leader, she's not a leader. But boy do they speak badly, every one of her people. Their judgment. She's got nothing going. Hillary Clinton put the office of Secretary of State up for sale. And if she ever got the chance, she would put the Oval office up for sale too.

My ethics reform plan includes a pledge to get foreign money out of American politics. Going to have to do it.

(APPLAUSE)

Why do you think they're making all these incredible deals in China and Mexico and all these countries? Why do you think? Do you think because the politicians are that stupid? Some of them are. But do you want to know? They have total control over our politicians. We have to get the money, foreign money out of our politicians pockets. My contract also includes a lifetime ban on government officials becoming lobbyists for foreign government. That includes a ban on former White House officials, lobbying on behalf of a foreign government during trade negotiations.

You know when you look at these horrible trade deals. They're not that stupid. I'm telling you. These are just bad deals. Because the other side, the side they're negotiating with is taking care of them folks. You know what? Look, I was on the other side. In case you haven't heard, I spent a long time on the other side. But I love this country so much. And I saw what was happening. And the day I announced on June 16th of last year, boy did I become an outsider. I think I became the all time, the all time outsider. And I'm very glad I did it. Because this is something again, this is something that has never, ever happened before or never close. And we're going to carry it home on November 8th.

(APPLAUSE)

At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back your jobs. Nobody even talks about that. You don't have politicians talking about that. Michigan has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA. You know it was Bill Clinton that signed that. A lot of people don't know that. A deal strongly supported by Crooked Hillary. Before NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today that number is down to less than 160,000 workers and it's going down fast. Under NAFTA, we eliminated our tariffs on Mexico. But Mexico raised their vat on us. It's a vat tax. A lot of people don't know what that means. It's now around 17 percent. So when we send products to Mexico, we pay a 17 percent tax, we don't even know it. In other words, when they signed the original agreement, it was defective. So instead of changing it, they don't change it. It was defective. We're changing it. We're going to probably terminate it and start all over again if you want to know the truth.

(APPLAUSE)

It's got to be a two way road. You know a two lane highway. Back and forth. Right now it's a one way highway right into their pockets. But when they ship products to us they can send them tax free. You understand that? It's defective because we have two different tax arrangements. So you have the vat and ours is ours. It's a 17, approximately 17 percent. So the agreement was defective when we made the agreement. Everybody knew it and nobody changed it. And that's why you don't see the stuff coming the other way. It's a one way highway. They get the jobs. They get the money. They get the factory. We get the drugs. We get the unemployment. We get the losses.

(BOOING)

Somehow -- -- somehow that's not too good. America's running, America's running a nearly $800 billion annual trade deficit. In other words, our great negotiators, we're losing in the trade deficit $800 billion almost a year. We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. True. It's the greatest job theft. You look at New England. You look at Michigan. You're one of the greats. You look at North Carolina. You look at all of our states. Some are effected incredibly. He just shouted out Ohio. Ohio's lost tremendous numbers of great jobs. You look at what's going on in Cleveland, Ohio, where we had an unbelievable convention by the way.

But you look at what's going on in Cleveland, Ohio. Company after company leaving. Our trade deficit with China grew almost 40 percent during Hillary's tenure as Secretary of State. Her trade deal with South Korea, her baby, killed another 100,000 American jobs. She said, oh come on.

(APPLAUSE)

BOB KNIGHT: Hey. Hey. My man needs a break up here. And I'll tell you what, ain't never going to wear out. He's never going to forget about all of us. And I want to tell you this fact to before, just to give him a little bit to rest here. How many of you? How many of you have ever been in the Armed Forces? Army, Navy, Air Force, raise your hand. Anybody who have been there. How many have a parent, a son, a daughter, whatever in our Armed Forces? Is there any organization in our country that deserves the absolute best, the absolute best treatment that we can give? Is there any other organization more important than our military? This man will see that our military will be always the best in the world. They will have the best conditions. They will be the most highly thought of organization in the United States. And he will see that our military is able to protect us from any problems that might arise anywhere. And will protect your sons and daughters who are in the military.

(APPLAUSE)

DONALD TRUMP: He's a great one. 900 wins. Thank you Bobby. That's true about the military. And it's true about the veterans. We're going to take care of your veterans. Hillary got rich selling your jobs to same special interests who pushed the jobs out of America. The people who have given her countless millions of dollars in campaign contributions. You know in Florida, it's 50 to one they say, commercials. 50 to one, and I'm winning. You know, in the old days, in the old days, you'd get credit if you spent less money and you won. Today they're saying, why isn't Trump spending more money? 50 to one, I'll have over $100 million of my money in this whole campaign. Which means I don't have to take it from others. But think of it.

(APPLAUSE)

50 to one. She raised, I don't know, $1.5 billion, something like that. And we're winning folks. We're winning. Can you believe this? 50 to one. I was down in Florida a couple of days ago. I was begging for an Ivory soap commercial, anything. Because every commercial was about Trump, negative. And by the way, really negative, nasty commercial. And they were so untrue, most of them. Most of them. No, they were untrue. But just look at the devastation, your area, 3,637 workers right here in Michigan. Most of those jobs went to Mexico. Leo Interiors laid off 320 Americans making automobile interiors. Their jobs went to Mexico, congratulations.

(BOOING)

Benteler Automotive laid off 233 Americans and sent those jobs to Mexico. Steel Case also laid off 870 workers, those jobs went to Mexico and Malaysia. Autodye, once the biggest tool and dye maker in the United States, one of the biggest in the world, laid off 300 workers, getting smaller all the time. The sheet metal parts and dyes they used to make right here. They used to make them right here, now come from China, South Korea and Taiwan.

(BOOING)

Ford laid off 2,155 workers. Those jobs went to various countries. But they're going to be going to Mexico more and more and more. Ford is moving all of its small car production, that's a big deal, to Mexico. And that's on top of the two and a half, you know the plant they built right? They built this massive plant. They built a plant that you wouldn't believe in Mexico. That's on top of it. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and will stop the jobs from leaving Michigan. And I've been saying that for a long time.

(APPLAUSE)

From now on, and I mean that folks, and folks, folks, it's not even tough. It's not like (INAUDIBLE). You know, you've been watching, I've been watching for 10 years these politicians talking about, how do we stop the outflow of our jobs and our companies leaving? And they give them interest free loans. And they give them all sorts of stuff. They didn't mean money. They don't need interest free loans. They have cash. But I've been watching it for years. And the one thing they don't do, they say, hey, you do this and there's going to be consequence. You do this you're going to have consequence. If you want to take your, fire all your employees, it's called consequence. From now on, it's going to be America first

If Ford or another company announces they want to move their jobs to Mexico or another country, then I will pick up the phone, even though it's not very presidential for me to be calling a head of a company, but it's so easy. I will call the executives, or I'll have Carl Icon do it, or I'll have, we have so much incredible at the top business people in the world some of them. And I will tell them. I have Bobby Knight. I'll have Bobby Knight make the call. I'll have Bobby Knight. I think he could make the call better than anybody. 900 wins Bobby. He's amazing. I'll have Bobby -- -- would Bobby do a good job? I think so. I will tell them that if they want to do that. They want to move all those, you know, people out of there. They're going to be unemployed now. And you want to hire other people from another country, we will charge a 35 percent tax when they try to ship their products back across what will be a very strong border.

(APPLAUSE)

It used to be the cars were made, you remember this right? Do you remember this? You're right. You've heard this. I love it. It used to be the cars were made in Flint. And you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Right? Now the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.

(BOOING)

But we're going to turn it all around. I was in Flint recently. That is a troubled place I want to tell you.

(INAUDIBLE) you talk about incompetent politicians. They take good water and then say let's give them bad water. They have clean water and they say, let's go to another source where it's bad. Who are these geniuses.

Yet as the people of Detroit suffer, Hillary wants to spend trillions of dollars toward government --

(INAUDIBLE) back. It's time to put America first. We're going to put America first. That includes a promise to cancel billions in climate change spending for the United Nations. A number Hillary wants to increase. And instead, use that money to provide for American infrastructure, including clean water, clean air, and safety. That's what we want. We're giving billions and billions and billions of dollars, President Obama, giving billions and billions of dollars. We don't even have any idea where it's going. And we owe, you know, we know $20 trillion right? We owe $20 trillion. We're giving money away like it's water, clean water.

I want to have clean water, crystal clean water. I want to have beautiful, beautiful clean air. And I want to have safety. That's what I want. And then I want to rebuild the infrastructure of this country. And put people back to work also. My plan also includes a pledge to reduce violent crime. Every child in this nation has a right to grow up in safety and peace. I want to go into the poorest neighborhoods and work on a national plan for revitalization. I want to turn decades of failure into generations of lasting success. Hillary on the other hand, wants to decimate what's left of manufacturing in Michigan with the TPP. Remember, she called it the gold standard of (INAUDIBLE).

(BOOING)

They don't even talk about monetary manipulations in this agreement. Which is the single greatest tool that foreign countries have for beating us. Right? They don't even talk about it. It's not even mentioned. The TPP will destroy the rest of your industry. It will take what NAFTA hasn't destroyed. A Trump administration will stop the Transpacific Partnership. And we're going to have trade.

(APPLAUSE)

And we're going to have trade. But it's going to be one, two, three, we're going to have individual deals with individual countries. And if they misbehave, we send them what's called a notice of termination. 30 days. And during that 30 day period, they'll most likely be desperate to keep it going and will make a better deal than we had. But we have to be smart. Right now, it's complex. It's many countries. It's a 5,000 page agreement. That nobody from our country has read. And these every countries, they know every comma, every period, every paragraph, every sentence. They study at night and our people probably barely read it. We will renegotiate NAFTA. And if we don't get the deal we want we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal.

(APPLAUSE)

We are going to lower taxes on America business from 35 percent to 15 percent. We are going to massively cut taxes for the middle class. We will unleash American energy, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. We will put our miners back to work by the way.

(APPLAUSE)

And as you know, China's dumping steel all over the place. We are going to put our steel workers back to work. Going to end that. The Obama-Clinton war on coal is going to cost this state 50,000 jobs. Not if I'm elected. We'll increase the number of jobs by a massive amount. We will also work to restore and protect the Great Lakes.

(APPLAUSE)

We are going to become a rich and proud country again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming to our shores.

(BOOING)

Hillary Clinton's immigration plans mean generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism, spreading into your schools and communities all over Michigan. When we win, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program.

(APPLAUSE)

And we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. Believe me.

(APPLAUSE)

And folks we all have heart. And we see what's going on and it's tragic. And we'll help them with safe zones in Syria. We'll get the Gulf states to pay for it. We don't have the money. We owe $20 trillion. But they have plenty of money and they haven't been stepping up. They'll step up. But we're going to help them with safe zones and other things. But we can't do it. We can, we don't want to have a modern day version of the Trojan horse. And that's what's going to happen. You see what's going on. Just take a look at Germany. Just take a look at France, Paris, and Nice. Just take a look all over the world. Just take a look. We have enough problems. A Trump administration will also secure, defend the borders of the United States. And yes, as I said, we will build a wall.

(APPLAUSE)

We received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. These are amazing people. Who frankly have a much easier job if I don't win. Because the people just walk right in. But these are great Americans. They're devastated. They see what's happening. They see who's coming in. And they say, we are going to give Donald Trump the first ever endorsement. They've never endorsed anybody before. They tell us the border crisis is the worst it's ever been. It's a national tragedy and a national emergency. They said that.

They also warn America has a horrible situation in store. It's the most radical proposal in U.S. history, according to a letter they just sent me with their endorsement. Most radical proposal in U.S. history. When I become president, we will end illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and put American workers first.

(APPLAUSE)

We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester. Which took all of our military out of, I mean the military, what's happening to our military? You know, we have planes, fighter jets that are so old, current fighter jets, that we can't buy parts for these planes. We have to get them from airplane graveyards and from museums. We will rebuild our badly depleted military and take care of our wonderful, wonderful people in the military.

(APPLAUSE)

That means new modern aircraft for Selfridge. Does anyone know Selfridge, Air National Guard base. We have the endorsement of 22 medal of honor recipients and more than 200 admirals and generals.

(APPLAUSE)

That's a great honor. Not only General Flynn who's a phenomenal man. Do we all love General Flynn? Tough. Tough and smart. We want tough and we want smart. He's both. We need a new foreign policy that puts America first. Hillary led us into the disaster in Iraq and Syria and Libya. She couldn't get us out of Iraq and ISIS was formed in the vacuum. Now I listen to her say, we will fight ISIS. Where was she when it was forming? Now ISIS is in 32 countries. She's an unstable person and she's totally trigger happy. No Secretary of State has been wrong more times, in more places, than Hillary Clinton. She unleashed ISIS and now wants open borders in the Middle East. Now think of it, she wants the Middle East to pour into our country. She wants everybody, come on in. Folks, she wants open borders. Let me just tell you, let me tell you, we have open borders in this country, we're not going to have a country anymore. And all you have to do is take a look at her record. Look what she's going through now. What a mess. Her policies spread death, destruction and terrorism wherever she's gone.

(LOCK HER UP. LOCK HER UP. LOCK HER UP.)

Hillary and our failed Washington establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East and not it's in worst shape than ever before. Right? If our President's went away and went to the beach, we'd be in a lot better shape than we are right now. Think of it. We spent $6 trillion. We could have rebuilt our country two times over. Imagine of some of that money had been spent on building new schools, roads, bridges, tunnels right here in Michigan. Now she wants to start a shooting war in Syria, in conflict with a nuclear armed Russia. That could, look, this could possibly drag us into World War II. Putin has no respect for her. He doesn't like her. He certainly doesn't like Obama. And I often say, wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with Russia and these other countries. Wouldn't that be a positive thing?

(APPLAUSE)

They act like it's going to be a terrible thing if that ever happened. The arrogant political class never learns. They keep repeating the same mistakes. They keep telling the same lies. They keep producing the same failed results. We don't win anymore folks. We don't win at war. We don't win with trade. We don't win with education, our system is horrible. You look at our educational process. Look at our system. We're last, so you have 30 countries that they judge. We are at the bottom of the list. We're number one in cost per pupil. But you have Sweden, and Norway and Denmark, and Japan, and China, and way down on the list is the United States. And you know what? Number one, number one in cost per pupil by far. How can Hillary manage this country when she can't even manage her email?

(LOCK HER UP. LOCK HER UP. LOCK HER UP.)

It's just one disaster after another. One scandal after another. One total betrayal after another. To all Americans I say, it is time for real leadership. We have to have it.

(APPLAUSE)

And just in finishing up, just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. Get ready for your jobs to start pouring back by the way. We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. She's going to raise taxes. Hillary is going to raise your taxes to almost 50 percent by the way.

(BOOING) We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job killing regulation. Cancel every illegal Obama executive order.

(APPLAUSE)

We are going to rebuild our military. And we are going to take care of our great, great, great veterans. Great people. Provide school choice to the children of Michigan and put an end to common core for once and for all. We'll bring education local.

(APPLAUSE)

Make childcare more affordable. Support the men and women of law enforcement.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to save our 2nd Amendment which is under siege. The NRA gave me their earliest endorsement ever, the National Rifle Association. They're great people. I tell you what, they love this country. And we're going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.

(APPLAUSE)

Hillary wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change. And wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C. I'm asking you to dream big. To push for bold change. And to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love for this country.

(APPLAUSE)

I'm tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day, when they really mean another decade. America is tired of waiting. The moment is now. You're never, ever going to have this change again folks. Not in four years. Not in eight years. Not ever again. This is it. Never going to have it again.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you. Thank you. All we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country. There is no challenge too great. No dream outside of our reach. Nothing. Nothing is outside of our reach. I tell you what, I've gotten to know the people of this country. I've been doing this for a long time. If you would have told me I was going to be a politician, I would have laughed. I would have laughed. I also would have behaved perhaps a little bit differently, but that's OK. Would have behaved a little bit differently.

Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done. The future relies with the dreamers, not the cynics, not the critics. Hillary has been there for 30 years and she's accomplished nothing. Everything she does works out badly. Just look at what's happening right now. She is the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. That's what's happening.

(APPLAUSE)

Our movement represents all Americans, from all backgrounds and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents and first time voters of which there are many.

(APPLAUSE)

We are asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice, not money and power, should rule the day. We are fighting for every citizen who believes the government should serve the people, not the donors, and not the special interests. We are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a better future. With your vote, in just eight days, can you believe it? Eight days.

(APPLAUSE)

We will get the change that you've been waiting for your entire life. This will be a day you will remember. And when you cast your vote on November 8th, that will be the most important vote you will ever cast.

(APPLAUSE)

That will be when our country started winning again. We will get rid of ISIS. And we will get rid of ISIS swiftly. We will be tough. But we have to get rid of ISIS. But we will build, we will build peace through strength. We are not a respected country. We are scoffed at and laughed at all over the world. We give $1.7 billion in cash.

(BOOING)

We give Iran back $150 billion and instead of being thankful, they feel embolden and they embarrass us with the 10 sailors. And they embarrass us with the ships. And they embarrass us in every way possible. This kind of stuff isn't going to happen anymore. Not going to happen anymore.

(APPLAUSE)

Last month, you read they had 800 people, tough ones, ready for deportation and they made a mistake. Instead of deporting them, they became United States citizens.

(BOOING)

To which I said, that's OK. That's OK. Call them up. Let them redo it. They can change it. And the people on the other end said, well that wouldn't be Constitutional.

(BOOING)

And the mistake was that it really wasn't 800 people. It turned out to be 1,800 people.

(BOOING)

It's not going to be that way. We're going to have a unified country. We're a totally divide country. We're a divide country. We're going to have a country of love. We're going to get along, like this room gets along. We're going to get along. You're going to be proud of your country again. You are going to be so proud of your country again. And your country is going to start to win again. And your country is going to be respected again.

(APPLAUSE)

Your going to respect your country. And hopefully, you're going to look at your president someday, and you're going to say, that was a great vote. He did a great job for us.

(APPLAUSE)

Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you everybody. God bless you. God bless you Michigan. God bless you. Get out and vote. Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)
