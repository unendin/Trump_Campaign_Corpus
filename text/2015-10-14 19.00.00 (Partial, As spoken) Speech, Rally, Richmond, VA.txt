DONALD TRUMP: Thank you. Well, that was big. Sixty seven percent to Trump. Can you believe it? Now, you've got to remember, you know, if we had two people running and you had 67 percent, that would be a landslide, right? That's a landslide. If you won with 67 percent, the press -- look at all of those cameras going back there. So many. So many! Look at all of the red lights.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Show the crowd, everybody. Show the crowd. Show the crowd.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) A lot of people outside that the fire marshal would not let in. So it's one of those things. But I will tell you that when you have 67 percent in a two-person race, that's called landslide. That's called massive victory. I don't think there's ever been a victory and here we have a thing called the economy. Would you say that's important? I think so, right? So 67 percent are in favor for Trump. Okay. We won this state by a lot, meaning the polls, by a lot. Now, a couple of these categories, I have to read them. Illegal immigration, important. We're going to build the wall. Okay? Believe me. We're going to build the wall.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Hundred percent. And you know, so we're going to build it. It will be paid for. Who's going to pay for the wall? Who is going to pay for the wall? So the next category -- the next category, which is so important -- that's okay. That's okay. That's all right. That's all right.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

That's all right. That's why we have freedom of speech, folks, you know and I'll tell you how dishonest the press is. We have thousands of people in this room, 6, 7,000. I think 7,200 people. We have about ten people over there. They'll get the headline. You won't. That's pretty disgusting. Pretty disgusting. But that's the way it goes. So illegal immigration, 55 percent want Trump. Thirteen percent to second place. That tells you something right there. Thirteen percent. Thirteen percent. On social issues, Trump is first. On foreign policy --

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

(CROWD CHANTING)

We want Trump! We want Trump! We want Trump! We want Trump! We want Trump! We want Trump! We want Trump! We want Trump! We want Trump! We want Trump! We want Trump! We want trump!

Thank you very much. That's great. Thank you very much. But it is true. I see a couple of cameras for about four people and they are going wild, the cameras. You know, it's so disgusting. But that's all right. On foreign policy, Trump number one, 34 percent on ISIS, who is going to handle ISIS? Trump 46. We're not going to play games. We're not playing games. We're not playing games.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

On the change on how we do in Washington, on the change, how are we going to change Washington? Who is going to do the most effective job? Trump. Sixty percent. Sixty. Sixty percent. Here's an important one. Best chance of winning in November. Trump number one. Forty seven percent. Amazing. So we're number one at 42nd and then you get into 16 and 10. That's a big difference. So we've all come a long way together. We've all tomorrow. And you know, we have a lot of bad people out there. They want to stop progress and you see it all the time. And I used the statement, the silent majority. The silent majority is back, folks. The silent majority is back.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

\(BREAK IN COVERAGE\)

I watched last night with Bernie Sanders and Hillary and the other three guys that nobody -- yes. Yes.

(BOOS)

The other three guys that nobody knows who the hell they are. Who are they?

But I watched last night as Hillary and Bernie Sanders, they just couldn't give things away fast enough and they are giving them to illegal immigrants. They want health care for illegal immigrants. They want driver's license for illegal immigrants.

They are suggesting -- listen to this. They are suggesting Social Security for illegal immigrants.
