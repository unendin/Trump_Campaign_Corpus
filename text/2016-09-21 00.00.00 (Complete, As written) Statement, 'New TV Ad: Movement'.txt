DONALD TRUMP: TRUMP CAMPAIGN: Today, the Donald J. Trump for President campaign released a new television ad entitled "Movement," a positive ad that captures the energy that has propelled Donald Trump in the polls over the last few weeks. This new television ad will run nationally on cable and select broadcast programming.

JASON MILLER: While Hillary Clinton distracts and diverts attention away from her horrific record with negative advertisements that lack substance, our campaign plans on promoting the positive energy that has turned Mr. Trump's campaign into a full-fledged movement. Donald Trump has been a successful businessman his entire life and is the only candidate that provides common sense solutions to the problems that face everyday Americans. Hillary Clinton has spent over two decades serving Washington D.C.'s rigged system, while Mr. Trump believes in the promise of the American Dream, and will never stop doing what it takes to Make America Great Again.
